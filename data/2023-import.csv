"Conche emulsifier breaker tripping repeatedly","The emulsifier breaker on the conche keeps tripping. We already increased it from 14A to 15.25A but it still trips. It happens with both 100% cacao and 70% recipes so it's not viscosity related. What else can we try?","The breaker amperage needs to be increased further. On the breaker there is a small wheel - rotate it clockwise to increase the threshold. If the emulsifier continues to trip after adjustment, it may indicate the cacao is under-refined and too thick when entering the conche, which puts extra load on the emulsifier motor.",Conche,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo, Alvaro",2023-01-06,Troubleshooting,"emulsifier, breaker, tripping, amperage, 15.25A, viscosity, under-refined"
"Ball mill alarm - breaker not tripped during cooling cycle","Ball mill shows 'breaker' alarm but no visible breaker is tripped. The temperatures are in the low 30s. Is something wrong?","This is normal behavior during a cooling cycle. When the product temperature exceeds the set point, the cooling system activates and the water temperature drops. The temperatures in the low 30s are normal during cooling. The product temperature activates the cooling system, while the water temperature activates the heating - these are independent systems. The alarm may be a false alarm that can be cleared.",Ball Mill,Software/PLC,low,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-01-18,Troubleshooting,"alarm, breaker, cooling cycle, temperature, false alarm"
"Ball mill screen unresponsive after transfer","After transferring chocolate out of the ball mill, the touch screen becomes unresponsive and we can't operate the machine. What could cause this?","This could be related to the FM bypass button being engaged or a power interruption similar to pressing the emergency button. Check if FM bypass is activated. Also check if the machine lost power briefly during transfer. Try pressing the blue rearm button to clear any emergency state. If the screen remains unresponsive, power cycle the machine.",Ball Mill,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-02-08,Troubleshooting,"screen, unresponsive, transfer, FM bypass, emergency button, touch screen"
"Ball mill water temp very low - won't restart","The ball mill water temperature is very low and the machine won't restart. How do we get it running again?","When starting the ball mill in auto mode from zero/cold state, you need to use the FM bypass button. The FM bypass allows the stirrer to start even when water temperature hasn't reached the minimum threshold (38°C). The water cools the product, then the heater brings the water temperature back up. Wait for water to reach at least 38°C before starting without FM, or use FM to bypass the temperature safety.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-02-14,Operation,"water temperature, FM bypass, restart, cold start, auto mode, 38 degrees"
"Conche heating element test - one pulling wrong voltage","We tested the conche heating elements and one is pulling 106V instead of 212V. How many elements are there and what does this mean?","The conche has 2 heaters with 3 heating elements each, totaling 6 elements. Each element is 1500W. If one reads 106V instead of 212V, that element is likely faulty. You need an electrician to do a continuity check on each element. The 4K1 electrical protection inside the cabinet protects the heating elements. Replacement 1500W elements can be ordered from Italy.",Conche,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-02-28,Troubleshooting,"heating element, 1500W, voltage, 106V, 212V, continuity, 4K1, electrician"

"Conche timer display showing 0 minutes in phases","The conche timer display shows 0 minutes remaining in all phases even though it's running. What's wrong?","This is a PLC software issue. Giacomo performed a remote PLC fix to resolve the timer display. After the fix, conche temperatures also improved significantly - reaching above 65°C compared to a maximum of 50°C before the fix. The timer display issue was causing the PLC to not properly manage phase transitions and heating cycles.",Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-04-05,Repair,"timer, display, PLC, software fix, remote, phase, temperature improvement"
"New processing line voltage requirements","What voltage do we need for the new processing line? Should it be 208V or 480V? Do the machines have UL certification?","The new line should be 480V 3-phase + Neutral + Ground at 60Hz. Each conche requires approximately 85A, and the main board needs 155A capacity. Regarding UL certification: individual components are UL labeled, but full board certification costs approximately 25,000€ and is not economically viable for custom-built machines. The machines meet all safety requirements but the electrical board assembly as a whole is not UL certified.",General - All Equipment,Electrical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo, Lorenzo Datei",2023-04-18,Installation,"voltage, 480V, 208V, UL certification, 155A, 85A, 60Hz, three phase"
"Conche download valve opens then immediately closes","The conche download valve opens momentarily then immediately closes. The chocolate won't discharge. What's causing this?","A level detector from the old sifter is sending a maximum-level signal that's blocking the valve from staying open. Juri excluded that sensor input in the PLC remotely, which fixed the issue. The old sifter's level sensor was still connected and telling the system the destination was full, causing the valve to close immediately after opening.",Conche,Software/PLC,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri, Giacomo",2023-05-03,Repair,"download valve, level detector, sifter, PLC, signal blocking, Juri"
"Pre-refiner roller shaft snapped - second time","The rear roller shaft on the pre-refiner snapped again at the motor connection point. This is the second time. Why does this keep happening?","The R4 pre-refiner frame is bent at the motor mount, causing misalignment stress on the shaft which leads to fatigue failure. A replacement roller needs to be shipped from Italy. For removal: spray penetrating oil on the bolts holding the rear roller and let it soak. The shaft breaks at the weakest point where it connects to the gearbox.

"Pre-refiner belt extremely tight during reassembly","We're trying to reassemble the pre-refiner belt but it's extremely tight and won't go on. We also noticed the R4 frame was swapped with R2. The front shaft is stuck.","Use WD-40 or penetrating oil on the front shaft if it's stuck. The belt alignment pin must align with the gearbox position. Make sure you are working with the correct frame - R4 and R2 frames are different sizes. To install the belt: loosen the motor mount nut to release tension, slide the belt on, then retighten. The belt should have some give when properly tensioned.",Pre-refiner,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-05-22,Repair,"belt, tight, R4 frame, R2 frame, WD-40, shaft stuck, alignment pin, tension"
"Ball mill pump not working - AIR IN clears blockage","The ball mill pump is not circulating product. How do we clear a blockage?","Use the AIR IN button to blow compressed air through the system and clear the ingredient blockage. Press pump reverse first, then press AIR IN in intermittent bursts (1 second on, 5 seconds off) for about 30 seconds while the stirrer is running. This forces air through the bottom of the tank and clears material blocking the pump inlet.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-06-07,Troubleshooting,"pump, blockage, AIR IN, reverse pump, recirculation, compressed air"
"Ball mill auto-start mystery - impossible without operator","Our ball mill appeared to start on its own. Is this possible?","No, the ball mill cannot auto-start. It is not possible for the machine to begin operation without an operator pressing the start button. There is no timer or automated function that would cause the machine to start by itself. Check if someone else may have started it, or if there was a misunderstanding about the machine's state.",Ball Mill,Software/PLC,low,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin",2023-06-14,Troubleshooting,"auto-start, safety, operator required, impossible"
"Roaster knocking noise - internal arm unwelded","The T100 roaster has developed a knocking noise that occurs at the same point in each rotation. It's been getting worse over months.","The noise is caused by internal mixing arms inside the drum that have come unwelded. Initially it may be a subtle click, but it escalates as the arm loosens further. Eventually the arm can break completely and fall into the beans. The drum needs to be removed to access and reweld the arms. Ensure welds are made with stainless steel welding rods for added material strength - welds without added material will crack again under the rotational forces of 100kg+ loads.",Roaster,Mechanical,critical,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-07-03,Repair,"knocking noise, drum arm, unwelded, broken, rotation, reweld, stainless steel rods"
"Roaster T100 front plate removal procedure","How do we remove the front plate on the T100 roaster to access the internal drum for repairs?","Giacomo provided a 6-page PDF guide: REMOVING THE T100 FRONT PLATE. Steps: Remove the front discharge hopper first. Then remove 3 bolts from the internal support and 3 bolts from the rear support. The drum slides off the shaft using penetrating oil to ease removal. The shaft stays in the roaster. Apply penetrating oil liberally and allow soak time for easier removal of seized components.",Roaster,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-07-10,Repair,"front plate, removal, T100, drum, shaft, bolts, penetrating oil, PDF guide"
"Roaster drum collar misalignment from broken arms","After running the roaster with broken internal arms, the drum collar appears misaligned. Is this related?","Yes, running the roaster with broken or loose arms caused the inner collar to rotate relative to the outer drum shell. The unbalanced forces from the broken arms gradually shifted the collar position. The collar needs to be realigned and the arms properly rewelded before operating the roaster again. Check the flange bearing as well for damage.",Roaster,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-07-15,Repair,"drum collar, misalignment, broken arms, rotation, realignment"
"Roaster flange bearing replacement specification","What is the correct flange bearing replacement for our T100 roaster?","The flange bearing is model UCF210-32 with a 2-inch bore.

"Pre-refiner won't turn on - motor overheating","The pre-refiner won't turn on at all. Nothing happens when we press the start button.","The motor is likely overheating due to the rolls being set too tight. When rolls are too tight, the motor draws excessive current and overheats, triggering the thermal protection. Let the motor cool down completely (may take 30+ minutes), then loosen the rolls before restarting. Adjust the roll gap to reduce the load on the motor.",Pre-refiner,Electrical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-08-09,Troubleshooting,"won't turn on, motor overheating, tight rolls, thermal protection, cool down"

"Storage tank 500kg noise - pump running dry without water","The 500kg storage tank is making a loud noise. What could be causing this?","There is no water in the jacket. The water pump is running dry, which creates the noise. Additionally, the heater could burn out without water in the jacket. Fill water through the side valve immediately. Once water is added, the noise will stop. Always ensure the water jacket is filled before turning on the heater or water pump.",General - All Equipment,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-08-28,Troubleshooting,"storage tank, noise, water jacket, pump running dry, heater, fill water"
"Ball mill 130 pump blockage with pre-refine","The ball mill 130 pump is blocked. We loaded 31kg of nibs (pre-refine) and it won't recirculate.","The pre-refine was not liquefied enough before loading. It needs more run time with the stirrer before the pump can move it. To clear: run the pump in reverse, press AIR IN in bursts, and keep the stirrer running at 50-60Hz. If that doesn't work, try opening the download valve to relieve back-pressure. The pump eventually cleared by using all three simultaneously (stirrer + reverse pump + AIR IN). In future, ensure the product is sufficiently liquefied before expecting recirculation.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo, Alvaro",2023-09-05,Troubleshooting,"pump blockage, pre-refine, nibs, recirculation, AIR IN, reverse pump, download valve"
"Ball mill 130 stirrer motor high-pitch noise","The stirrer motor on ball mill 130 is making a high-pitched noise. Could it be the gearbox?","Check the gearbox oil level. The dipstick is a bolt on the edge of the gearbox. Important: wait at least 20 minutes after stopping the stirrer before checking, as the oil needs time to settle back down to give an accurate reading. Low oil level in the gearbox causes the high-pitched noise. The oil should be checked and replaced every 6 months, especially on used equipment.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-09-12,Troubleshooting,"stirrer motor, high pitch, gearbox, oil level, dipstick, 20 minutes"
"Ball mill solidified chocolate emergency","Chocolate solidified inside the ball mill. The stirrer won't turn. Can we add cocoa butter to melt it?","DO NOT start the stirrer - it will damage the gearbox if forced against solidified chocolate. Adding cocoa butter won't help because it just sits on top of the solid mass. The only solution is to physically scoop the balls out by hand. This is a labor-intensive process but necessary to prevent damage to the stirrer motor and gearbox.

Two previous runs were fine.","The issue was the torque device (clutch) between the motor and gearbox. This safety clutch prevents gearbox breakage during overload. A small switch on the torque device was triggered by vibration, preventing the motor from starting. Solution: open the top cover of the machine, locate the torque device, and adjust the position of the switch so it's not touching the rotating parts. Additionally, Riccardo found the VFD drive had parameter E1-04 set incorrectly (max speed limited to 50Hz).

"Ball mill temperature spike and drop - Mistral interaction","Ball mill temperature spiked 10 degrees above set point (from 53 to 68°C), triggered alarm. Then after turning off Mistral, temperature dropped too low (30s) and wouldn't allow transfer. Why?","When the product temperature exceeds the set point plus the 10-degree delta, a high temperature alarm triggers - this is normal protection. The temperature spike may be caused by the Mistral being on at the wrong time. When temperature drops after a cycle ends, the jacket water is cold from the cooling phase. The temperature safety won't allow restart until water reaches 38°C. Solution: keep FM and BP engaged at all times during operation.

"Ball mill temperature drop after cycle prevents restart","After each ball mill cycle, we have to wait 10-15 minutes for temperature to recover before the mill will restart. Water and product temps drop 7-10 degrees below set point.","This happens because at the end of a cycle, the product reached max temperature which caused cold water to circulate. When trying to restart, the temperature safety prevents operation until water warms back up. Solution: always keep both FM and BP buttons engaged during operation. FM specifically bypasses the water temperature safety check. As long as the chocolate is liquid, the stirrer and pump will be fine. If viscosity is too high and amps exceed the max set value, the breaker will trip as an additional safety.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2023-11-13,Operation,"temperature drop, restart delay, FM button, BP button, water temperature, bypass"

Also check that the pump speed for discharge to sifter is not too high - try 30Hz to prevent overflow issues.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2023-12-04,Troubleshooting,"mag trap, solidifying, temperature, laser thermometer, phase 4, holding"
"Conche CO1000 software upgrade to match CO250 features","Can the CO1000 conche get the same software features as the CO250, including saved recipes?","Yes, the same software as the CO250 can be loaded onto the CO1000 via remote update. The conche must be empty for the software modification. Schedule a day when the CO1000 will be empty. Additionally, the level sensor from the CO250 can be moved to the CO1000, but requires a wiring modification and software update to work with the two connected ball mills. This prevents sifter overflow issues.",Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-12-05,Operation,"software upgrade, CO1000, CO250, recipes, level sensor, sifter overflow"
"Ball mill water temperature much lower than set point","Both ball mills have water temperature approximately 20 degrees below the set point. The outside is cold to the touch and chocolate is hardening on the walls.","The mills are working normally. The water temperature drops as needed to maintain the product temperature below the set point. Even if the jacket feels cold, the product temperature probe is reading correctly. The chocolate will not set as long as the product temperature is at the proper level. The water and product temperatures operate independently - cold water temperature during active milling is expected behavior.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2023-12-07,Operation,"water temperature, cold, set point, product temperature, independent systems, normal behavior"
"Conche level sensor wiring modification for CO1000","Can we move the level sensor from the CO250 to the CO1000 to prevent sifter overflow?","Yes, but the sensor needs to control the CO1000 discharge valve to prevent overflow in the sifter. This requires both an electrical wiring modification and a software update. The level sensor must be connected to the CO1000 PLC so it can close the discharge valve when the sifter is full. Additionally, the two ball mills connected to the CO1000 may need wiring connections to the sensor. Giacomo will check the CO250 electrical diagram and provide the modification plan.",Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-12-07,Installation,"level sensor, CO1000, CO250, sifter overflow, wiring modification, PLC"
"Roaster drum arms broke again after rewelding","The internal arms of the T100 roaster broke their welds again after being rewelded previously. What's causing repeated failures?","If the welds were made without adding material (stainless steel welding rods), they will crack again. The 100kg+ rotating load generates enormous forces. Welds must be made WITH stainless steel welding rod filler material for sufficient strength. Simple fusion welds between the pieces without added material will fail. After rewelding with proper rods, check the drum rotation for rumbling noise at temperature - if noise occurs at the same rotation point, the reweld may have caused thermal expansion issues or the drum/collar may be off-center.",Roaster,Mechanical,critical,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-12-11,Repair,"drum arms, reweld, stainless steel rods, filler material, weld failure, repeated"
"Roaster temperature probe depth","How deep should the temperature probes go into the T100 roaster?","Alvaro provided a photo showing the probe positions.

"Roaster rumbling noise after rewelding at operating temperature","After rewelding the T100 drum arms, the roaster produces loud rumbling at operating temperature but is quiet at room temp. The sound occurs at the same point each rotation.","This could be thermal expansion of the welded metal causing interference. Check if the drum is rubbing against the front plate by removing the front discharge hopper and visually inspecting during rotation at temperature. The rewelded arms may have shifted the drum's center of rotation slightly, or the thermal expansion at operating temperature causes the drum to contact the frame at one point per revolution.",Roaster,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2023-12-12,Troubleshooting,"rumbling noise, rewelding, thermal expansion, drum rubbing, front plate, rotation"
"Sifter throughput reduced by 1/3 after recipe change","After reducing butter from 18% to 12% in our 46% dark chocolate recipe, the sifter throughput dropped by about 1/3. Can we adjust the sifter to compensate?","With less butter, the chocolate is thicker which reduces flow rate through the sifter. Provide the exact new recipe and the vibration speed setting on the sifter driver (inside the electrical board). The vibration speed can be adjusted to improve throughput. Also, the pump speed from conche to sifter should be set appropriately - try 30Hz to match the sifter's processing capacity. Reducing butter content significantly changes the viscosity profile.",General - All Equipment,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro, Franklin",2023-12-12,Operation,"sifter, throughput, recipe change, butter reduction, viscosity, vibration speed"
"Roaster pilot flame dying at 90°C","The T100 roaster pilot light and flames go out completely when the roaster reaches approximately 90°C. This started happening repeatedly.","Check these potential causes in order: 1) Gas supply - verify adequate pressure and flow rate to the burners (blue indicator light shows gas is passing through). 2) Ventilation - check for wind/draft blowing down the chimney or blockage causing improper ventilation. 3) The flame extinguishing at a consistent temperature suggests a thermal safety cutoff may be triggering, or gas pressure drops when demand increases. A video of the flame dying can help diagnose - have the gas company check the supply and regulator.",Roaster,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2023-12-18,Troubleshooting,"pilot flame, dying, 90°C, gas pressure, ventilation, chimney, thermal safety"
"Conche 250 not heating up despite water and power","The 250 conche is connected to water, heaters are on, breakers are good, but it's not generating heat. We can't hear the water pump working.","Press RESET first. If that doesn't work, switch off the machine completely, wait 1 minute, then switch on again. The power cycle resolved the issue. If this recurs (heating up then going cold overnight), monitor whether the system needs a reset each time. Check if the water pump is actually running - the pump must be active for heaters to turn on.

"Conche 250 water level drops after filling","We fill the conche 250 water jacket completely but the level drops below half on the sight glass after releasing the EV button. Is this a leak?","This is normal behavior. The water level indicator does not need to be at the top to indicate full. The conche is full when water starts flowing out to the drain pipe. Once water levels out after releasing EV, wherever it sits in the indicator is the max fill level. This conche has never shown full on the water level indicator - this has been noticed and commented on previously. It is not a water leak.",Conche,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2023-12-20,Operation,"water level, sight glass, EV button, normal behavior, CO250, not a leak"
"Conche 250 water refill procedure","How do we refill the water jacket on the conche 250?","Two methods: 1) Hold the EV button until water comes out the drain pipe - when water exits the drain, the conche is full. 2) In manual mode, change product temperature set value to below the current read value (green number) - this opens the solenoid automatically. When water flows to drain, it's full, then set the temperature back up. After filling, turn on water pump and heaters. The water will circulate through all pipes. Best practice: fill with water pump on simultaneously, then top off with EV.",Conche,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2023-12-20,Operation,"water refill, EV button, solenoid, manual mode, CO250, drain pipe"
"Conche 250 loses heat overnight repeatedly","The conche 250 heats up to set point but is cold the next morning, repeatedly over several days. No breakers tripped, no water leaks visible.","After investigation, the temperature was reaching set point but then not maintaining. The orange reset button should be checked. After a power cycle (off for 1 minute, then back on), the conche heated back up to set point and held. Monitor whether it maintains temperature. If it consistently drops overnight, there may be a PLC or relay issue causing the heaters to shut off.
