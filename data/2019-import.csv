"Electrical box height placement","How far off the ground should the electrical boxes be placed? What height does the power come out of the equipment?","Depends on local regulations (1.4m in Europe). The red pentagons on the machine layouts indicate electrical connection points. Wire exit heights from floor by machine: Roaster 700mm, Winnower 800mm, Pre-refiner 250mm, Mill 50 300mm, Conche 450mm, Sifter 400mm.",General - All Equipment,Electrical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-09-05,Installation,"electrical, installation, wiring, height, placement"
"Equipment power cords - length and plugs","Do the machines come with cords attached? Do they have plugs? What is the length?","Machines come with cords attached but no plugs. The cord length is 3 meters.",General - All Equipment,Electrical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-09-06,Installation,"power cords, plugs, length, installation"
"Ball Mill and Conche water inlet/outlet heights","What is the height of the water inlet and outlets for both ball mill and the conche?","Refer to the cut sheets (mill 50.pdf and conca 250 2019.pdf) which contain the exact dimensions for water inlet and outlet positions.",Ball Mill / Conche,Hydraulic,low,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-09-08,Installation,"water inlet, water outlet, plumbing, height"
"Ball Mill water consumption rate","Is the 150 L/h water flow a constant rate or divided over the course of an hour? What is the actual volume/rate?","The overall water consumption is 1/3 of 150 L/h (around 40 gal/h). However, when the water inlet is actively required (1/3 of the time), the flowrate must be 150 L/h.",Ball Mill,Hydraulic,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-09-08,Installation,"water flow, consumption rate, plumbing"
"Roaster uncrating and placement","Is there anything to know ahead of time when taking the roaster out of the crate? Do both the cooling carousel and roaster have wheels?","Both units (roaster and cooling carousel) have locking caster wheels similar to the conche. Use a forklift to take them off the crates, then they roll easily into position on the ground.",Roaster,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2019-09-11,Installation,"uncrating, placement, forklift, casters, wheels"
"Roaster vent pipe sizes - US sourcing","The roaster vent measurements are 150mm and 80mm which don't translate to standard US pipe sizes (5.9 inches and 3.15 inches). Where can these be sourced in the US?","Alvaro provided the pipe specs used for his NY installation and a supplier document (1487_001.pdf). Contact the local plumber's supplier referenced in the document.",Roaster,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2019-09-13,Installation,"vent pipe, exhaust, sizing, sourcing"
"Gas regulator pressure for roaster","The water column should be 8.03-9.65 but that doesn't seem to correlate to 20-30 mbars. What is the correct gas pressure?","Natural gas pressure required: Minimum 20 millibar, Maximum 24 millibar. Conversion to water column: Min 8.03729, Max 9.64475. The 20-24 millibar range is determined by the burner. Note: the 30 mbar figure on the valve data sheet is the valve's maximum rating, not the operating pressure.",Roaster,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-09-30,Installation,"gas pressure, regulator, millibar, water column, natural gas"
"Roaster BTU load","What is the BTU load for the roaster burner?","The burner power is 94.203 kW, which equals 321,434.91 BTU/h.",Roaster,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-10-03,Specification,"BTU, burner, power, gas"
"Bean sorting screen size","What screen size is needed for bean sorting?","10mm was slightly too large. Use 9mm for the top mesh. For the bottom mesh, 7mm or 7.5mm is recommended - this separates small beans and anything smaller falls through as waste.",Sifter,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2019-10-03,Specification,"screen, mesh, sorting, sifter, beans"
"Operating roaster slightly under 20 mbar gas pressure","If gas pressure is just slightly under the minimum 20 mbar, is that OK?","It may work but watch for two issues: 1) If the pilot flame does not cover the safety electrode due to lack of gas, the burner switches off automatically (safety feature). Fix by increasing pilot flame intensity. 2) It may take longer to heat the machine and roast the beans as the burner flame intensity is lower.",Roaster,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-10-04,Troubleshooting,"gas pressure, pilot flame, safety electrode, burner"
"Accessing roasting data from USB","How do I access the roasting data to produce graphs and roasting curves?","The data is stored on a USB pendrive behind the touchscreen. Open the electrical board, take the pendrive, transfer data to a computer. Files are CSV format - import into Excel to create graphs. Replace the pendrive after. The USB must be plugged in before starting production. The machine only records data during the roasting cycle (same data shown on the touchscreen graph).",Roaster,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-10-04,Data Management,"roasting data, USB, CSV, graphs, curves, pendrive"
"Conche - draining chocolate from lower ball valve","How do I get chocolate out of the conche from the lower ball valve?","Open the valve and turn on the pump. Have a bucket ready - the pump is powerful and can make a mess. To drain completely, use buckets and take it all out.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2019-10-05,Operation,"drain, valve, pump, chocolate, unloading"
"Ball Mill refining time for cacao","How long should cacao be refined in the ball mill? Chocolate came out gritty.","For dark chocolate: 1) Cocoa mass alone for minimum 45 minutes (30 min may not be enough depending on the cacao - hard fibers require more time). 2) Then add sugar and refine another 30-60 minutes. Check with micrometer - target 25 microns before adding sugar.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei / Franklin",2019-10-05,Operation,"refining, particle size, gritty, microns, timing"
"Reworking gritty chocolate - adding cocoa butter","When remilling gritty chocolate, how much cocoa butter should be available? When to add it?","Have 2-5% cocoa butter available. Monitor the amps on the display - when amps reading is 1-2 amps less than the max value shown on display, add cocoa butter 500g at a time. Remilling can boost viscosity so CB may be needed to compensate. May not be necessary at all.",Ball Mill / Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2019-10-05,Operation,"rework, cocoa butter, viscosity, amps, remilling"
"Remote monitoring of conche","Is there any way to remotely log into the conche to see if it's on or if the heater went off?","No remote access available for the customer. Remote connection is only for Packint service/remote assistance purposes.",Conche,Software/PLC,low,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-10-06,Operation,"remote access, monitoring, conche"
"Conche magnetic trap cleaning - possible clog","The magnetic trap had chocolate in it. The pump sounds different - is the conche clogged?","If chocolate came out when opening the magnetic trap, it's flowing. Check for partial clogging in: the valve before the pump, the filter, or the pipe back into the conche. If flow appears normal, no intervention required for now. Check fully when the conche is emptied next. Keep an ear on the pump sound.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2019-10-06,Troubleshooting,"magnetic trap, clog, pump, filter"
"Beans falling into cooling carousel during roasting","Beans are falling into the cooling carousel while roasting. Why?","The door is open or slightly open. Check for obstructions preventing the door from closing fully - a bean or two lodged in the door can prevent it from sealing. Also verify air pressure to the piston is adequate.",Roaster,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei / Alvaro",2019-10-16,Troubleshooting,"door, cooling carousel, beans, obstruction, air pressure"
"Electrical burning smell during roasting phase 2-3","Getting a strange electrical burning smell between phase 2-3 of the roast cycle.","Possible causes: 1) Power supply wire touching machine wall. 2) Wrong sealing material on vent pipes (metal tape melting). 3) Vent pipe material not rated for the temperatures. 4) Issues in the chimney/exhaust system. Locate exactly where the smell originates - if not at machine level but higher up, check the chimney installation. Pipe temps: ~100F up to elbow then jumps to 135F.",Roaster,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-10-17,Troubleshooting,"smell, burning, electrical, exhaust, vent pipe"
"Ball Mill to Conche automatic transfer - D Timer","How do I automatically move chocolate from the ball mill to the conche? How much time is needed?","Set the D Timer on the ball mill. For first production: download manually (open 3-way valve with stirrer and pump ON), time how long it takes to empty the mill. Use that time as the D Timer setting for future automatic batches. Alternative: set a hypothetical D timer (e.g., 15 min) for first run, stop manually when empty, then set exact time for next batch. Second production onward can be fully automatic.",Ball Mill,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-10-18,Operation,"D timer, automatic transfer, download, 3-way valve"
"When to add cocoa butter in ball mill process","When is the best time to add cocoa butter during ball mill refining?","For 60% and 70% recipes: Add CB BEFORE the sugar - otherwise insufficient fat for machine to work properly. Process: 1) Cocoa mass, reduce to 50 microns (50-60 min), 2) Cocoa butter (100% or 50%), 3) Lecithin (if used), 4) Sugar, 5) Remaining cocoa butter if split. For 80%: Can add CB 3 minutes before downloading to fluidify and help with easier download.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri / Franklin",2019-10-18,Operation,"cocoa butter, recipe, sequence, sugar, viscosity"
"Cleaning ball mill between milk and dark chocolate","What is the best way to clean the ball mill between milk and dark chocolate?","Use cocoa butter for cleaning: Ball Mill 10kg = 5kg CB, Ball Mill 50kg = 10kg CB, Ball Mill 130kg = 25kg CB. Run for 10 minutes. For the conche on the same system: initial manual scraping first, then use the same CB from ball mill cleaning to flush residual from conche pipes. Sunflower oil can be used but must follow with CB to remove oil residue (unless recipe includes sunflower oil).",Ball Mill / Conche,Preventive Maintenance,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin",2019-11-01,Cleaning,"cleaning, changeover, cocoa butter, milk chocolate, dark chocolate"
"Conche pneumatic valve not closing completely","The download valve on the conche won't close completely. Air is at 6.5 bar. Chocolate is leaking from the download pipe end.","Troubleshooting steps: 1) Remove the pneumatic actuator, 2) Manually close the valve with a wrench (refer to tutorial PDF and videos provided), 3) Test dry before running chocolate. If valve still won't close manually, the valve itself is defective and needs replacement. A replacement valve was shipped. Cause can be chocolate buildup or defective valve. Disconnect air line and bend/tape closed as temporary fix while using manual download valve.",Conche,Mechanical,critical,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei / Giacomo",2019-11-13,Repair,"pneumatic valve, actuator, leaking, download pipe, valve replacement"
"Conche vibration with partial load","The conche and display screen are wobbling/vibrating quite a bit with only 150kg loaded. Is this normal?","Normal in two cases: 1) When the emulsifier (shear stress device) is not covered enough with chocolate (as with partial load), or 2) When chocolate is extremely thick. With full 250kg load, vibration would be negligible. The emulsifier spinning at high speed with low chocolate level creates a vortex causing vibration. May also hear a loud SCRATCH sound - this is air being blown in by the emulsifier. Not a problem.",Conche,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2019-11-14,Operation,"vibration, wobbling, emulsifier, partial load, vortex"
"Replacing conche pneumatic valve procedure","How do I replace the conche download valve? How to manage chocolate in pipes during replacement?","Steps: 1) Turn off machine (water circuit won't auto-fill when off), 2) Close water and air supply, 3) Drain water until level is below minimum on transparent water level indicator, 4) Place a small bucket under horizontal tube to catch chocolate (vertical tube won't be a problem), 5) Replace valve - approximately 1 hour. Test new valve dry (no chocolate) first. Tighten bolts on flange to align if bent. After reassembly, refilling water takes a while.",Conche,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo / Lorenzo Datei",2019-11-22,Repair,"valve replacement, procedure, water drain, chocolate management"
"Roaster drum volume and small batch testing","What is the volume ratio of the roasting drum? How to do small test batches (e.g., 5kg vs 35kg)?","Drum theoretical capacity is approximately 80-90kg of beans. At 35kg, the empty space is 2.5-3x the bean space. Key density facts: 1kg beans = ~2 liters volume, water is 1:1, liquor is 1.1kg/L, chocolate is 1.2kg/L. For small batches: Temperature/time is NOT proportional to volume. A 1/5 batch needs much more than 1/5 the time. For small batches (5kg): lower temperatures significantly - try 120-130C for 10min then 100C for 15min. The sampler handle won't catch beans in small batches. Small batch profiling is largely empirical.",Roaster,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2019-11-15,Operation,"small batch, test roasting, volume, density, scaling"
"Conche temperature settings - water temp vs product temp","What is the difference between product temp and water temp on the conche? How do they impact each other?","Water Temperature = HEATING temperature. Product Temperature = COOLING ceiling. Example: WT at 57C and PT at 70C means water heats to 57C, and if product exceeds 70C, cooling water activates. For conching at 75-80C: Set Phase X with WT 75, PT 80. For cooling phase: Set Phase Y with WT 45, PT 50.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2019-11-24,Operation,"temperature, water temp, product temp, heating, cooling"
"Conche emulsifier speed and flavor impact","How does changing emulsifier speed impact flavor and viscosity? What is the top speed?","Higher speed = higher rate of viscosity reduction. Max speed is 60Hz. However, some products suffer from too-intense shearing (milk chocolates, protein chocolates). For Dominican beans (floral/delicate): keep temperature below 55C, emulsifier at 50Hz, shear stress device ON for no more than 8-12 hours total. The shear stress primarily affects viscosity, not flavor as much as temperature and extraction (blower) duration. To preserve more flavor: decrease temperature and reduce blower ON duration. If conche is not full, it will vibrate at 60Hz.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2019-11-24,Operation,"emulsifier, speed, viscosity, flavor, Hz, Dominican"
"Roaster blower setting causing slow heating","Roasting 35kg batch - machine set at 180C but product only reached 53C after 27 minutes. What's wrong?","The blower (smoke extractor) was set to 15 seconds ON, which is too much. This extracts too much heat. Correct setting: 3-5 seconds ON every 1-2 minutes. The blue line on the display is the drum/environment temperature (the one to monitor). The red line is the product temperature (measured among the beans). After correcting the blower setting, verify: Blue temperature, Red temperature, and Burner ON status after loading beans.",Roaster,Software/PLC,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri / Lorenzo Datei",2019-11-26,Troubleshooting,"blower, heating, temperature, slow roast, smoke extractor, settings"
"Roaster smoke during operation and fire risk","Warehouse fills with smoke during/after roasting. Debris bin was smoldering and almost caused a fire.","Causes: 1) Small powder/shell particles contact hot drum and can burn - clean machine daily with compressed air through the download port. 2) Debris bin MUST be emptied at end of every day. 3) Check if blower/smoke extractor motor is actually spinning (remove black cover with 3 screws to verify). 4) If smoke only occurs during bean download to cooling carousel, high bean temperature can generate smoke. 5) Verify exhaust pipes have proper draft - measure chimney height from roaster to roof top. 6) Water infiltration in exhaust pipes can damage the blower motor. A manual blower control button can be added to the panel for use during downloading.",Roaster,Safety,critical,"Packint Tech Support - Juri / Lorenzo Datei",2019-12-13,Troubleshooting,"smoke, fire risk, blower, cleaning, compressed air, exhaust, safety"
"Roaster exhaust condensation and water leaking","Getting condensation/water dripping underneath the roaster near the 4-inch exhaust pipe.","The moisture is coming from outside, not from the machine. Causes: 1) Exhaust pipes are not double-jacketed, creating condensation when machine is turned off (hot air meets cold pipe). 2) Rainwater entering from the top of the chimney outside. Solution: Install double-jacketed exhaust pipes and/or weatherproof caps on chimney tops. Check the top of the chimney outside for water entry points.",Roaster,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-12-13,Troubleshooting,"condensation, water leak, exhaust pipe, chimney, double jacket"
"Conche chocolate leaking after valve replacement","After replacing the conche valve, chocolate leaked from the pipe curve area overnight.","If residual chocolate remained in the pipe curve when the tank was removed, it can leak out. Solution: Place a small bucket under the pipe for a short time after each unloading to catch any residual drips.",Conche,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2019-12-06,Troubleshooting,"valve, leak, residual, pipe, bucket"
"Roaster cleaning with compressed air","How do I clean inside the roaster cylinder to prevent smoke and debris buildup?","Move the cooling carousel aside. Use compressed air blown through the download roaster door to clean inside the cylinder. No disassembly of the roaster is required. Clean at the end of every working day (preferred) or before the first production of the day.",Roaster,Preventive Maintenance,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2019-12-06,Cleaning,"cleaning, compressed air, cylinder, debris, preventive"
"Second conche valve failure - not responding to touchscreen","New replacement valve is not closing when button is pressed on the touchscreen.","Troubleshooting steps: 1) Check if valve is warm (should be). 2) Open and close valve manually with wrench. 3) Run some chocolate through the pipe. 4) Then try operating with the touchscreen button again. If the pneumatic actuator appears to try to move but is blocked, the issue may be chocolate buildup rather than valve defect.",Conche,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2019-12-10,Troubleshooting,"valve, touchscreen, pneumatic, actuator, not closing"
"SEVIO drive not recording roaster data","The SEVIO drive has not been recording any roaster data since installation. Why?","Verify that the USB pendrive is properly inserted in the port behind the touchscreen. The pendrive must be inserted BEFORE starting production for data to record. Check physical connection and ensure drive is functional.",Roaster,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-12-31,Troubleshooting,"SEVIO, data recording, USB, pendrive, touchscreen"
"Rapid connector identification","What is the connector type shown in the equipment photo?","It is a rapid connector (quick-connect fitting).",General - All Equipment,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-09-12,Specification,"rapid connector, fitting, quick connect"
"Roaster recipe visibility during roasting","Is there a way to see what recipe is running during a roast?","In manual mode, you are running the manual recipe. In automatic mode, the recipe title appears on the main page. Push on the title to see the recipe parameters. To view the roasting curve, navigate to the graph page.",Roaster,Software/PLC,low,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2019-11-20,Operation,"recipe, display, automatic mode, graph, parameters"
"Minimum roast batch size and scalability","What is the minimum amount of beans to do test batches? What is the correlation from 5kg to 35kg?","There is no official minimum but small batches are problematic: the sampler can't reach beans at low volumes. Temperature/time relationship is NOT proportional - a batch 1/5 the size needs much MORE than 1/5 the time. For 5kg test batch: try 120-130C for 10min then 100C for 15min (much lower than 35kg profiles). This is largely empirical - no established mathematical model exists for this specific roaster.",Roaster,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2019-11-15,Operation,"minimum batch, test roasting, scaling, temperature, timing"
