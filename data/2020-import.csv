"Roaster hydraulic tilt adjustment for bean download","Beans are remaining in the roaster drum for over 5 minutes after tilting. Is it possible to adjust the hydraulic tilt angle? Also happens more in manual mode than auto.","Yes, the pneumatic cylinder screw at the rear can be adjusted to increase inclination, but be careful not to increase the angle too much as it can cause instability. Normal download time is around 2 minutes. The download time setting is the same for automatic or manual mode. Set drum rotation to 2 min forward and 2 min reverse (top left parameters) for better bean movement.",Roaster,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin",2020-01-04,Troubleshooting,"hydraulic, tilt, download, bean stuck, inclination, pneumatic cylinder"
"Ball Mill restart time after overnight shutdown","The ball mill was shut down overnight. How long do we need to wait before it is safe to use again?","Minimum 3 hours, or long enough until all the residual chocolate inside the mill is completely melted.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin",2020-01-21,Operation,"restart, shutdown, wait time, residual chocolate, melting"
"Processing Allulose sweetener in ball mill","Do you have any experience working with Allulose as a sweetener? Any advice for processing it in the ball mill?","Keep the product temperature under 45°C. Allulose is 70% as sweet as sugar and is often used in combination with other sweeteners like stevia. It has 1/7th the particle size of sugar. Keep additional cocoa butter ready to add, and monitor the amps on the display closely.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2020-02-12,Operation,"allulose, sweetener, temperature, cocoa butter, particle size, amps"
"Roaster temperature spikes between roasts","Roaster set at 185°C but drum temp spiked to 238°C between roasts with no beans loaded. Burners were off (only pilot on) but temp kept climbing.","Three possible causes: 1) Gas pressure is too high (gas company may need to adjust), 2) The T-pipe on the exhaust fan is obstructed with husk, 3) The small exhaust fan is not working. Check the T-pipe for blockage, verify the fan turns on (set fan to 30 seconds ON to test), and verify gas pressure. The machine has no pressure regulator - only a safety valve that operates between specific pressures. When machine is empty, temperature changes are more evident due to less thermal inertia. Increase fan ON time from 8 to 15 seconds in Phase 1 to better control temperature.",Roaster,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2020-02-25,Troubleshooting,"temperature spike, gas pressure, fan, T-pipe, husk blockage, safety valve"
"Roaster 3-phase recipe design for debacterization","How should I design a 3-phase roasting recipe? What is the purpose of each phase?","Phase 1: High temperature for debacterization only (e.g., 185°C, 10 min, speed 50, blower ON 15 sec / OFF 1 min). Phase 2: Fast cooling (e.g., 135°C, 5 min, speed 40, blower ON 240 sec / OFF 1 min). Phase 3: Actual roasting (e.g., 135°C, 20 min, speed 50, blower ON 8 sec / OFF 1 min). The principle is a quick hit of high heat for debacterization, then rapid cooling, then controlled roasting. Temperature and time can be varied for any origin.",Roaster,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2020-02-26,Operation,"recipe, 3-phase, debacterization, cooling, roasting, blower settings"
"Conche emulsifier speed range and minimum load","Can the emulsifier speed be adjusted? What is the speed range? What is the minimum load for using the emulsifier?","Speed range: 60 Hz (fastest) to 20 Hz (slowest). Minimum load to use emulsifier: 150 kg. The emulsifier dramatically decreases viscosity - 6 hours of emulsifier use can release up to 4% of cocoa butter stuck on particle surfaces (measured with viscometer).",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2020-02-26,Operation,"emulsifier, speed, Hz, minimum load, viscosity, cocoa butter"
"Conche won't start - temperature below 40°C","Changed conche settings and it wouldn't restart. The display showed water temp at 38°C with set point at 40°C.","The conche will not start when water temperature is below 40°C. This can happen if: 1) A cooling phase ended and nobody switched to manual mode, 2) Phase 4 duration expired (even 9999 minutes ends eventually), 3) The machine sat idle without a running program. The product temperature must always be set 2-3°C higher than the water temperature. If water temp is set to 50 and product to 45, the machine will constantly cool because product T is lower than water T.",Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2020-02-27,Troubleshooting,"temperature, won't start, 40 degrees, phase settings, water temp, product temp"
"Conche phase temperature rules - water vs product","What should the water temperature and product temperature be set to for each conche phase? The machine got cold unexpectedly.","Water Temperature = HEATING temperature. Product Temperature = COOLING ceiling. Product temp must ALWAYS be 2-3°C higher than water temp. Example for San Martin origin: Phase 1: Water 55, Product 58. Phase 2: Water 50, Product 53. Phase 3: Blower on, all else same. If product temp is set lower than water temp, the machine will constantly try to cool. If the machine gets cold, it's likely because the program phases ended and no one was monitoring.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2020-02-27,Operation,"temperature, water temp, product temp, phase settings, heating, cooling"
"Conche pump making unusual noise","The conche pump is making a strange high-pitched squealing noise that can be heard throughout the factory. The noise changes with pump speed changes.","Possible causes: 1) Bearing in the pump motor, 2) Debris stuck between the flange and the lobes, 3) Impurity in the servo fan. First locate the origin of the sound (front/pump body vs back/motor). The servo fan runs at constant speed regardless of pump speed. If noise changes with speed, it's likely from the pump body, not the servo fan. Pump manufacturer says to keep using it - if it's a bearing issue, they'll replace the motor. Try cleaning with compressed air and flushing with cocoa butter after batch is done.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2020-02-28,Troubleshooting,"pump noise, squeal, bearing, servo fan, flange, lobes"
"Winnower and pre-refiner inverter trips - voltage fluctuation","Winnower fan won't start. Pre-refiner also shut off. What's going on?","Both machines tripping indicates a systemic issue - likely voltage fluctuation. When voltage drops, amps go up (kW = amps × volts), causing breakers to trip from high amps or heat. Measured voltage was only 209V across all 3 phases. Check voltage with a multimeter for each phase combination (1-2, 2-3, 1-3) - one phase might be down entirely. Monitor these events as voltage fluctuations can damage electronic components like PLCs and HMIs. For the winnower: the inverter trips for reasons including low voltage, high load, or impurities inside the fan.",General - All Equipment,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2020-03-16,Troubleshooting,"inverter trip, voltage, breaker, amps, phase, winnower, pre-refiner"
"Pre-refiner grease leak from bushing","Grease is leaking from the pre-refiner rollers. Black grease visible on the shaft and underneath the front roller.","The grease loss comes from the bushing and is caused by overheating of the lubricating oil, which becomes more fluid when hot. Clean the rollers and roller shaft thoroughly - remove the blades and clean everything well. Blow with compressed air where the grease residue is visible. Let the machine cool down, then restart and check if it still leaks. No parts need to be removed or moved - just clean the residues.",Pre-refiner,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2020-04-02,Troubleshooting,"grease leak, bushing, overheat, lubricating oil, rollers"
"Pre-refiner belt cuts from teflon blade residue","What is causing cuts in the pre-refiner conveyor belt?","The teflon blade at the front of the belt (underneath, where the product drops off) cleans excess cocoa mass so the belt returns clean. If residue builds up on this blade, it can cut into the belt. The blade tension itself hasn't changed since installation, but residue buildup on the blade causes the issue. Clean the teflon blade regularly to prevent buildup.",Pre-refiner,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin / Alvaro",2020-04-02,Preventive Maintenance,"belt, cuts, teflon blade, residue, cleaning"
"Conche emulsifier inverter trip - viscous chocolate","Conche shows 'Error Emulsifier' on the display. How do I fix it?","The inverter trips because amps exceeded normal levels. Causes: 1) Voltage too low, 2) Product too viscous or cold, 3) Mechanical problem. First try: switch off for 90 seconds then turn on. If the error persists with viscous chocolate, reduce emulsifier speed to 40 Hz. If the error still shows, check the breaker inside the electrical cabinet - it may be tripped/down. Increasing emulsifier speed on viscous chocolate (e.g., from 50 to 53 Hz) can cause breaker trips. For very viscous product, lower the speed.",Conche,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2020-04-22,Troubleshooting,"emulsifier, inverter, error, viscosity, breaker, Hz, amps"
"Conche recipe profile for milk chocolate","What conche settings work well for milk chocolate?","Phase 1 (6h): Water 50, Product 52, Emulsifier ON at 50 Hz, Blower ON, Mistral ON, Pump ON, Stirrer ON. Phase 2 (3h): Water 45, Product 47, Emulsifier ON at 30 Hz, Blower OFF, Mistral OFF, Pump ON, Stirrer ON. Phase 3 (3h): Water 42, Product 45, Emulsifier OFF, Blower OFF, Mistral OFF, Pump ON, Stirrer ON.

"Ball mill to conche pipe clogged","Chocolate won't transfer from the ball mill to the conche through the 3-way valve. Oil was added but nothing flows to the conche, though the manual valve works and oil recirculates within the mill.","There is chocolate stuck in the pipes after the 3-way valve, likely in the vertical pipe section up to the elbow. Solution: 1) Open the 3-way valve and run the pump in reverse, 2) Simultaneously shoot compressed air into the pipe opening on the conche side, creating a cap/seal with the air gun to maximize pressure, 3) If air blasting clears the clog, you should see bubbles in the ball mill. If unclogging fails, you must disassemble the pipe and clean it (requires draining water first). In this case, the air gun method eventually worked after multiple attempts.",Ball Mill / Conche,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri / Lorenzo Datei",2020-05-18,Troubleshooting,"pipe clog, 3-way valve, transfer, air gun, compressed air, pump reverse"
"Ball mill restart after power outage - password","Power went out overnight and the ball mill won't start with the door open. How do we restart it?","Press the FM button on the touchscreen. It requires a password: enter 1111 in the 'level password' field (the LAST line on the password screen, not the username field). This resets the safety interlock that requires the door to be closed.",Ball Mill,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri / Giacomo",2020-05-21,Troubleshooting,"power outage, restart, password, 1111, FM button, door interlock"
"Conche PLC modification for saved profiles","Is it possible to modify the conche PLC to save multiple conching profiles like the roaster has?","Yes, Juri will work on programming saved profile functionality for the conche PLC.

"Conche power outage recovery limitations","When we have a power outage, the machines restart but we don't know what phase they were in. Can the PLC remember the previous state? Can we install a UPS?","Unfortunately, if the machine switches off due to power outage, there is currently no way to go back to the phase in which the machine stopped. A UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) can be installed to keep the PLC powered during outages.

"Roaster USB data logging - FAT32 format","The USB drive for recording roast data needs to be reformatted. What format should it be?","Format the USB drive as FAT32. The pendrive must be inserted in the USB port behind the touchscreen BEFORE starting production for data to record. If the drive keeps losing data or asking to be reformatted, Packint can have their Omron technician check remotely - leave the machine on (electrically) overnight so they can access it.",Roaster,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2020-06-22,Data Management,"USB, FAT32, pendrive, data logging, format, Omron"
"Checking anodes for wear","How do I check the anodes for wear? Where are they located?","Drain the water from the machines first. Ball mill anodes: accessed from the rear door. Conche anode: located in the front underneath the main panel - remove a metal panel to access it. The water level indicator should also be removed and washed with soap and water, then blown with compressed air to clean well.

"Conche pump seal replacement - gearbox seal consumed","Pump is leaking oil (not just chocolate) from the gearbox area. The pump also makes a loud noise during startup and shutdown.","The seal where the motor shaft enters the gearbox has been consumed and needs replacement. The loud noise is caused by over-tightening the packing seals (should only be tightened 15-20 degrees per nut). Replacement seals shipped via TNT Express (tracking: 944824938). A video tutorial for seal replacement was also provided. The pump supplier confirmed that the startup noise is from seal friction on the pump shaft and will diminish as seals wear in slightly.",Conche,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri / Franklin / Martina",2020-07-03,Repair,"pump seal, gearbox, oil leak, noise, packing gland, tightening"
"Conche emulsifier breaker trip from speed increase","Recently increased emulsifier speed from 50 to 53 Hz and the breaker tripped. Is 53 Hz too fast for viscous chocolate?","Yes, increasing speed on very viscous product can cause the breaker to trip because the higher speed draws more amps. For viscous chocolate, the emulsifier speed should be lowered, not increased. Check the breaker in the electrical cabinet and reset it. Access the speed setting through the touchscreen to reduce it back.",Conche,Electrical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin",2020-09-11,Troubleshooting,"emulsifier, breaker trip, speed, viscosity, amps, Hz"
"Conche not responding - water temperature too low","Conche was running in manual mode with stirring and pumping, then stopped responding in both manual and auto mode. No alarms visible, breakers OK.","The problem was water temperature - it was set to 52°C but had dropped to 49°C. The conche won't operate when water temperature falls below the minimum threshold. Once the temperature came back up, the machine started working again. Monitor water temperature settings and ensure the machine maintains adequate temperature.",Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2020-09-26,Troubleshooting,"not responding, water temperature, threshold, manual mode, auto mode"
"Conche melting solidified chocolate safely","The conche went cold and chocolate solidified with a thick layer on top. When is it safe to turn on the stirrer?","Turn on the stirrer ONLY when the chocolate inside is COMPLETELY melted. If you turn on the stirrer with solid chunks still present, you risk damaging the shaft. Set the water temperature to 55°C to gradually melt the chocolate. To speed up melting, you can increase water temp but keep it reasonable. The product temperature should always be set 2-3°C above the water temperature.",Conche,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2020-09-30,Operation,"solidified chocolate, melting, stirrer, shaft damage, temperature"
"Conche maximum fill level - bearing protection","If we fill the conche to the absolute maximum, are we getting the most efficient conching? What is the max safe level?","Fill level must stay BELOW the bearing cover on the stirrer shaft. If chocolate rises above this cover, it can reach the bearings at the top, then the bottom, and ultimately damage the gearbox. Also watch the motor amps - breakers and inverters can trip with excessive load. The bearing cover/shell at the top of the shaft protects the bearings and gearbox from chocolate intrusion.",Conche,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei / Juri",2020-10-06,Operation,"fill level, maximum, bearing, gearbox, overflow, amps"
"Roaster door stuck closed - shaft dust buildup","The roaster door won't open to drop beans into the cooling carousel. Air pressure is fine and the machine tilts up, but the door stays closed.","The door shaft is likely clogged with dust buildup. Solutions: 1) Clean the shaft with compressed air, 2) Use a rubber hammer carefully to free the door, 3) Force the door arm down by hand. Also double-check air pressure - the tilt and door opening are sequential, so the compressor may have enough air to tilt but not enough remaining for the door. Clean the door shaft regularly with compressed air to prevent recurrence.",Roaster,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri / Alvaro",2020-10-06,Troubleshooting,"door stuck, shaft, dust, compressed air, air pressure, piston"
"Bean temperature vs drum temperature explained","Why can't the product (bean) temperature reach 100°C even after 35+ minutes of roasting at 175°C drum temp?","The 'product temperature' probe is only a REFERENCE value - it cannot accurately measure actual bean temperature because beans are in constant movement in the drum. The drum temperature is the real control parameter. A recovery test showed the drum reaches 175°C in only 3 minutes after loading beans, meaning the burner works perfectly (even faster than older models). The double-burner model has excellent heating. Focus on drum temperature for roasting decisions, not bean temperature. Use a laser thermometer on sampled beans for true bean temperature measurement.",Roaster,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2020-10-13,Operation,"bean temperature, drum temperature, probe, reference value, recovery time"
"Conche water pump flashing red and green","The water pump on the conche is flashing red and green. All pipes are cold but the tank is warm.","Red and green flashing means: 1) Under-voltage, or 2) Overheating of the pump motor. Troubleshooting: Check incoming voltage with a multimeter, check water temperature and ambient temperature around the pump. First fix: Turn off the water pump only (not the entire machine) for 10 minutes, then turn it back on. The pump has auto-protection and will restart automatically when the issue becomes less severe. In this case, the 10-minute rest resolved the problem. If it recurs, have an electrician check the voltage. Pipes will take time to warm back up - check the filter for melted chocolate residual to know when flow is restored.",Conche,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2020-10-27,Troubleshooting,"water pump, flashing, red green, under-voltage, overheating, auto-protection"
"Roaster door not opening fully - piston adjustment","The door on the roaster isn't opening or closing fully. Compressed air is at 6 bars. Lots of buildup visible on the door frame.","Clean the door and door frame first - buildup on the frame prevents normal opening. The pneumatic piston has two flow control screws (red and blue): Red controls air flow for OPENING the door, Blue controls air flow for CLOSING the door (double-effect piston). To increase door opening force: turn the red (lower) screw counterclockwise 2-3 full turns to increase air flow. First tighten the piston arm screw that connects to the door, then adjust the flow controls. If the door still won't open, a video call with tech support can guide you through the adjustment. Clean the door shaft regularly with compressed air.",Roaster,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri / Lorenzo Datei / Franklin",2020-10-30,Repair,"door, piston, air flow, red screw, blue screw, buildup, cleaning"
"Roaster cooling carousel safety cover removal","Is it possible to remove the stainless cover on the cooling carousel? There are sensors that would need to be disabled.","The cover is a security cover to prevent hands from entering while the stirrer runs. To remove: 4 screws at the 4 corners of the hopper. However, removing it eliminates the safety protection. To bypass the microswitches: Juri can modify the PLC program to remove the microswitch signals, OR you can make electrical bridges in the electrical board. WARNING: Packint cannot modify safety protections per law - a signed waiver is required stating this is the customer's request and releasing Packint from liability for any injury or damage.",Roaster,Safety,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2020-10-31,Operation,"cooling carousel, safety cover, microswitch, bypass, waiver, liability"
"Conche timer and phase display not working correctly","The conche doesn't keep time for each phase. It shows Phase 3 but the timer shows nothing. A 16-hour process that should have ended is still showing Phase 3 with all functions running instead of just 3.","Juri identified the problem remotely - there was a wrong address in the PLC program (his mistake). He corrected it by loading modifications to the touchscreen remotely. After the fix, Phase 3 was correctly counting time. If you need to sift chocolate, wait for the PLC update as the pump requires the PLC to operate.",Conche,Software/PLC,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2020-11-02,Troubleshooting,"timer, phase display, PLC, wrong address, programming error, remote fix"
"Conche vibration and seal tightening with full load","The emulsifier is at 50 Hz and the conche is vibrating intensely with a full load. There's also chocolate visible in the pump area.","Check if all feet are touching the floor - an uneven foot can cause vibration. The pump seals may be consumed and need tightening. Packint sent a PDF tutorial: 'Procedure to Tighten the Chocolate Pumps Seals.' If vibration persists, reduce emulsifier speed (reduced from 50 to 38 Hz in this case). Check feet leveling first, then tighten seals per the tutorial.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri / Martina",2020-11-01,Troubleshooting,"vibration, feet, emulsifier, seals, tightening, oscillation"
"Conche Mistral not powering on in Phase 3","The Mistral is set to ON in the conche program but it's not showing power on the heat gun during Phase 3.","Juri forgot to include the Mistral control for Phase 3 in the PLC program when he made previous modifications. He fixed it remotely. The Mistral was working correctly in Phase 4 but had been omitted from Phase 3 programming.

"Winnower dust control solutions","The winnower bag is very porous and puts fine dust throughout the factory. Can the bag be replaced with something less porous? Can it be piped to a sealed container?","The bag must remain porous to allow proper airflow for bean separation. Changing the mesh type would impede airflow and affect winnowing quality. There is no way to blow air into a sealed container as it would eliminate airflow. The best solution is to enclose the winnower area - build walls on the side and front (back wall against concrete isn't needed). The winnower, roaster, and destoner are the three dustiest machines and Packint recommends keeping them in a separate environment. Metal sheet enclosures extending to the ceiling are the recommended solution.",Winnower,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei / Alvaro",2020-11-14,Operation,"dust, winnower bag, airflow, enclosure, separation, porous"

Questions about pipe connections, positioning relative to the existing 50kg mill, and measurements needed for the layout.","The MILL130 should align with the MILL50 in the approved layout. If the conche is moved against the rear wall, the MILL130 will shift toward center of room. In the approved layout, the conche should be 11.53 inches from the MILL50. Packint sent wiring diagrams for the mill 130 and sifter 900. Measurements between the conche basin and the MILL50 are needed to confirm the layout.
