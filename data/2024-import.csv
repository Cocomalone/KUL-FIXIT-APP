"CO5000 Teflon blade shifted and scraping conche wall","The Teflon blade on the CO5000 conche has shifted about 1cm and is now scraping against the wall. It happened after unmelted drops entered the conche and caused violent shaking that bent the emulsifier shaft. What caused this and how do we fix it?","The violent shaking was caused by unmelted drops entering the conche, which bent the emulsifier shaft and shifted the Teflon/Derlin blade. The blade material is Teflon or Derlin. The CO5000 requires a minimum of 3000kg of chocolate to operate the emulsifier safely - running it with less product can cause similar issues. The emulsifier speed range is 25Hz minimum and 40-45Hz maximum. To fix: the emulsifier shaft needs to be straightened or replaced, and the blade repositioned. The safety door bypass (2 bridges in diagram) exists but is dangerous and not recommended.",Conche,Mechanical,critical,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo, Alvaro",2024-01-15,Repair,"CO5000, Teflon blade, scraping, emulsifier shaft, bent, unmelted drops, shaking, Derlin, minimum 3000kg"
"Zinc anode sizing per machine type","What size zinc anodes do we need for each machine? They all look different sizes.","Zinc anodes come in three sizes: the longest ones are for the conches, the smallest ones are for the mill reservoir, and the medium-sized ones are for the mill tanks. Each mill tank requires 2 anodes. The anodes protect against corrosion in the water circuit and should be replaced when significantly corroded.",General - All Equipment,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2024-02-05,Specification,"zinc anodes, sizing, conche, mill reservoir, mill tank, corrosion protection"
"Mobile pump preparation - flush first pass","How should we prepare the mobile pump before transferring product?","Always flush the first pass from the mobile pump into a bucket for cleaning purposes.

"Mill-50 water jacket leak from sight glass gaskets","Our Mill-50 is leaking water from the reservoir sight glass area. Also, how does the auto-refill function work?","The water leak is coming from the sight glass gaskets on the reservoir. Replace the gaskets to stop the leak. Regarding auto-refill: the system has an EV solenoid valve and a manual fill valve. The auto-refill function can be set to 999 minutes with a 16-hour cycle interval. When activated, the solenoid opens periodically to top off the water jacket automatically. Make sure the manual fill valve is also accessible for manual top-ups when needed.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2024-02-20,Repair,"Mill-50, water jacket, leak, sight glass, gaskets, auto-refill, EV solenoid, 999 minutes, 16 hour cycle"
"Mill-50 water temperature set too high","Our Mill-50 water temp is set to 52°C with product at 55°C. Is this correct?","The water temperature is set too high. The recommended setting is 40°C for water and 45°C for product temperature for standard chocolate processing. For white chocolate, use 40°C water and 45°C product. There should always be a 5-10°C difference between water and product temperature settings.

Can we adjust the internal screw?","Try cleaning the switch with WD-40 first. The switch is not serviceable internally - there is no adjustable screw that will fix it. If cleaning doesn't resolve the sticking, the entire switch needs to be replaced. The switch only works properly when mounted correctly on the door with proper alignment. When the hinge doesn't go back far enough past 90° to reset, it indicates the switch mechanism is worn.",General - All Equipment,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2024-04-15,Troubleshooting,"Pizzato, safety hinge switch, TK500CC, sticking, WD-40, not serviceable, replace"
"Stirrer motor high-pitched hum fixed via VFD parameter","The stirrer motor is making a high-pitched humming noise. What's causing it?","The high-pitched hum is caused by a VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) parameter setting. This can be adjusted remotely by Andrea to eliminate the noise.

"T100 roaster internal support bars breaking off drum","We found that internal support bars inside the T100 roaster drum have broken off. How do we inspect and fix this?","Check the welds on the internal support bars by looking through the access holes from outside the cylinder, as well as inspecting inside the drum directly. The bars break due to weld fatigue from the rotational forces of heavy bean loads (100kg+). All bars need to be rewelded using stainless steel welding rods for added material strength. Welds made without added material will crack again. This is a recurring issue if not properly addressed with stronger welds.",Roaster,Mechanical,critical,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2024-05-10,Repair,"T100, roaster, support bars, broken, drum, welds, stainless steel, fatigue, reweld"
"Chiller water connections - which port is inlet vs outlet","How do we identify which port is the inlet and outlet on the chiller water connections?","The top connection is the water inlet (IN) and the bottom connection is the outlet (OUT). The yellow-black indicator valve marks the inlet side. Remember: top = in, bottom = out. The chiller system uses a heat exchanger with two separate circuits - the chiller glycol circuit and the machine water circuit do NOT mix.

"Ball mill pump clog with allulose recipe","The Mill-50 pump is clogging when processing a recipe with allulose. The product turns into a concrete-like mass. We've made this recipe before without issues.","The clog is likely caused by humidity in the allulose ingredient. When allulose absorbs moisture, it can cause the product to harden into a concrete-like consistency that blocks the pump. Check the ingredient packaging - open or improperly stored packages absorb humidity. The same recipe can produce different results depending on ingredient humidity levels. Ensure all ingredients, especially allulose, are stored in sealed containers and check for moisture before use.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2024-06-01,Troubleshooting,"Mill-50, pump clog, allulose, humidity, concrete, blockage, ingredient storage, moisture"
"CO250 liquid sensor not activating","The liquid sensor on the CO250 isn't activating. What should we check?","Check the connector connections to the sensor and ensure they are properly seated. Clean the sensor head - contamination can prevent proper readings. The liquid sensor switches the position of the 3-way valve. If the sensor detects product, it switches the valve to allow flow; if it doesn't detect product, the valve stays in the default position.

"Mill-50 pump can't push canola oil to conche","The Mill-50 pump can't push canola oil 7 feet up to the conche. The oil is too thin/fluid for the pump to move.","Canola oil is too low viscosity for the positive displacement pump to effectively push it vertically. Add sugar and 0.05% lecithin to increase viscosity so the pump can grip the product. Important: do NOT run sugar through the system without lecithin for more than 15 minutes, as dry sugar will damage the pump seals and create excessive friction.",Ball Mill,Operation,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo, Alvaro",2024-06-15,Operation,"Mill-50, pump, canola oil, low viscosity, add sugar, 0.05% lecithin, 15 minutes max without lecithin"

"Melting tank motor oil leak between motor and gearbox","The melting tank motor is leaking oil. How do we determine if it's mechanical oil vs cocoa butter?","The leak is from the oil seal located between the motor shaft and the gearbox. To confirm it's mechanical oil and not cocoa butter: collect a sample, let it cool, and taste test it. Black residue on the shaft is normal grease and not indicative of a problem. The oil seals need to be replaced.

"Ball mill safety relay failure after power outage","After a power outage the ball mill shows an emergency button alarm and nothing works. The OMRON G9SB-200-D safety relay appears to have failed.","To diagnose: bridge terminals T11-T12 and T21-T22 on the safety relay to test if the relay is the problem (NOT T11-T21 and T12-T22 - that's incorrect). If the valves start working with the bridge in place, the relay is faulty. To further test: disconnect wire from terminal 13 (wire 01) and connect it to the wire on terminal 14 (wire 1) - connect these two wires together to exclude the safety relay. To eliminate the emergency alarm signal, connect wire from terminal 23 to terminal 24. The relay costs approximately €205 and ships from Italy (about 5 business days). The OMRON G9SB-200-D has no reset function - if contacts fail, the entire relay must be replaced.

Wire connections are at positions 3/16-3/17 (blue button) and 3/18-3/19, 3/20-3/21. Remove all black jumpers - only use the red wires. Switched 1 goes to terminal 23 on top, second wire to terminal 14 on bottom. After installation, if it still shows the fault: check voltage between wires 01 and 2 - should read 24VAC (not DC). Input voltage at the panel should be 208V across phases. A loose wire under breaker Q3 was the root cause in one case - wire 2 was loose under Q3.

"Melting tank capacity - no visual fill indicator","Is there a visual indicator for the 1000kg capacity on the melting tanks?","No, there is no visual fill indicator on the melting tanks. Each side holds 1000kg maximum, with max fill being nearly to the melting grate. If you've lost track of the quantity, the best option is to melt more butter. Even if you have the exact amount needed, you need at least 75-100kg extra to ensure there's enough product to fill the vertical pipe going up from the tank to the mixer.

"Conche 2 ball valve stuck - won't open with actuator","The 3-way ball valve on Conche 2 (CO5000) won't open. The actuator moves but the ball valve itself is stuck. Even manually with a wrench it requires extreme force.","The ball valve requires tremendous leverage to open manually. It opens counter-clockwise 90°. The notches/lines on the valve show the direction of the openings in the ball. To troubleshoot: (1) Remove the 4 bolts to remove the pneumatic actuator. (2) Try manually turning the valve stem with a wrench - if it won't turn, the valve is stuck internally. (3) The valve can be disassembled by unscrewing the nut to access the sphere for cleaning with hot water and high pressure. However, the sphere cannot be fully removed as it was inserted with a special machine. If cleaning doesn't resolve the resistance, the entire valve needs to be replaced.

"Tank level sensor testing during manual valve operation","If we manually leave the conche ball valve open, will the level sensor still stop the pump?","The level sensor should still stop the pump even with the valve manually held open. However, this is not guaranteed since the valve will still register as closed in the system. Before relying on this: test the level sensor by touching the probes with your hand or a metal object while the pump is running.

"Pump seal tightening procedure for chocolate pumps","How do we maintain and tighten the chocolate pump seals?","Packint provides a detailed PDF procedure for tightening pump seals. The seals use teflon gaskets that need uniform tightening. Key points: (1) Tighten evenly around the circumference to ensure uniform compression. (2) This is ongoing maintenance - the teflon wears over time and needs periodic retightening. (3) The seal life depends on tightening accuracy and can last several years with proper maintenance. (4) When the teflon gasket can no longer be tightened further, it needs to be replaced entirely.

Step 2: Disconnect the 1/2-inch water pipes from the valve. Step 3: Remove the actuator (4 × 8Ma bolts). Step 4: Unscrew the valve flange bolts. The water circuit is open (not pressurized), so there's no air to bleed when refilling. After reinstalling the valve and reconnecting all 1/2-inch water pipes: turn on the water pump and heater. If water was lost from the circuit, use the EV button on the touch screen to refill.

"Conche pump protection - amperage not pressure based","Does the conche pump have a pressure relief valve? What triggers the fault?","The pump does not read pressure - it uses a frequency converter (VFD) that monitors motor amperage. When the motor draws too many amps, the VFD triggers a fault and stops the pump. There is no PRV (pressure relief valve) in the system. The set amp limit triggers a shutdown to protect the motor.

To reset: turn off the entire electrical panel for at least 2 minutes, then turn it back on. This resets the inverter alarm. The max amp limit for the pumps is approximately 9A. If the fault persists after reset, the product may be too viscous - try adding cocoa butter to reduce viscosity or lower the pump speed.

During the original installation, the cooling water temperatures were different than the current operational temperatures, so the protection mode thresholds were set incorrectly. When the chiller water got cold enough during production, it triggered the temperature protection which stopped the pumps. Packint remotely modified the temperature protection parameters so they no longer interfere with pump operation during the auto cycle. It is critical to maintain constant chiller water conditions going forward - if you change the chiller settings, Packint may need to readjust the temperature protection parameters again.",Ball Mill/Conche,Software/PLC,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2024-11-18,Repair,"SOTU 600, remote monitoring, temperature protection, chiller water, pump shutdown, parameter modification"
"SOTU 600 sugar loading before fats - recipe and tare issue","The SOTU 600 is loading sugar before cocoa butter and mass, which is the wrong order. The sugar feeder activates first instead of the liquids.","This happens when the recipe or tare weight is incorrect. Check: (1) The tare of the mixer must be set correctly (should be approximately 4kg for empty mixer). (2) Verify the recipe weights match your production sheet. (3) If the mixer already has weight in it that the system doesn't account for, it thinks the liquid ingredients are already loaded and skips to sugar. Re-tare the mixer when empty, reload the recipe, and start the auto cycle fresh.",Ball Mill/Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2024-11-25,Troubleshooting,"SOTU 600, sugar loading order, tare, recipe, weight, mixer, auto cycle"
"Leaving chocolate in mills overnight causes separation and high amps","After leaving chocolate in the mills overnight, the stirrer draws high amps and triggers inverter protection. Why?","Leaving chocolate unstirred in the mills overnight causes separation - the cocoa butter rises to the top while solids settle to the bottom. This creates a thick sticky mass at the bottom. When you start the stirrer, it hits this heavy mass and draws excessive amps, triggering the inverter protection. This is NOT a machine malfunction - it's a protection against the abnormal load. To recover: lower the stirrer speed until it can move the mass without alarming (try 35Hz, then 30Hz if needed). Once the product is remixed and flowing, gradually increase speed. Strong recommendation: never leave chocolate unstirred in the mills overnight. If production must stop, transfer product to the conche or mixer where it can be stirred.",Ball Mill,Operation,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo, Alvaro",2024-11-20,Operation,"overnight, chocolate separation, high amps, inverter protection, stirrer, cocoa butter rises, solids settle, lower speed"
"SOTU 600 pump buttons delayed response on touch screen","During auto cycle, pump buttons on the touch screen have a delayed response - they activate minutes after being pressed instead of immediately.","Clean the touch screen thoroughly - dirt and chocolate residue can cause phantom touches and delayed inputs. The touch screen does not work like a computer with input queuing. If buttons appear unresponsive, don't press them multiple times as each press registers and will execute later. Also check: (1) water and product temperatures must not be too low (pumps won't operate in manual if temps are below minimum), (2) level sensor forks must be clean, (3) verify the cycle selector is in the correct mode (MAN vs AUT).",Ball Mill/Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2024-11-06,Troubleshooting,"touch screen, delayed response, pump buttons, clean screen, phantom touch, MAN, AUT selector"
"TK500 safety hinge switch cable replacement - finding the splice","How do we replace the safety hinge switch cable on the TK500 tank? The cable changes from black to grey partway.","The cable is spliced along the path from the switch to the terminal block because the switch cable isn't long enough to reach directly. Follow this procedure: (1) Disconnect the old cable at the terminal block inside the electrical panel. (2) Follow the grey sheath from the panel toward the tank. (3) The splice is inside the grey sheath between the tank crosspiece and the electrical panel. (4) You must remove the old cable to route the new one. (5) Leave the grey cable section connected to the terminal block and reconnect the new switch cable to the splice point.

"SOTU 600 lecithin loading method during auto cycle","When and how should we load lecithin during the SOTU 600 auto cycle?","Load lecithin directly through the mixer door grid while the auto cycle is running - there is no need to stop/pause the cycle. Open the mixer door and pour the lecithin through the grid. If you pause the cycle to add lecithin, the mixer agitator also stops, which is unnecessary.

"SOTU 600 sampling during refining without stopping","How do we take a product sample during refining without interrupting the auto cycle?","Take the sample from the pipe that goes from the Mixer to Mill 1. Open the Mill 1 door to access the pipe while the cycle continues. Note: opening the door will stop the Mill 1 stirrer (safety interlock), but the rest of the cycle continues. Set a longer refining time than expected (e.g., 100 min instead of 70) to give yourself time to test and decide whether to continue refining or start the automatic unloading phase.

The sequence matches the PLC display layout left-to-right. When splitting ingredients between two hoppers, ensure each hopper has the correct weight programmed. If only one hopper has weight programmed but the total amount is split between both, you'll need to manually load the second portion or adjust the recipe.",Ball Mill/Conche,Operation,low,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2024-08-15,Operation,"dry feeder, sequence, powder first, sugar second, left right, PLC display"
"Mill and mixer pump speed settings for SOTU 600","What speed should the pumps be set to when starting?","Set pumps to 50Hz for standard operation. In auto mode, the pumps auto-adjust based on level sensors but don't change the set value on the touch screen - the system manages speed internally. The minimum auto-adjusted speed is 30Hz in auto mode. Below 30Hz, pumps can be damaged from insufficient flow. Do NOT manually set pump speeds below 30Hz.

"Thick chocolate without lecithin causing SOTU 600 pump issues","We're making chocolate without sunflower lecithin for a client. The mills keep getting max level alarms and the chocolate is very thick.","Without lecithin, the chocolate is much more viscous. The pumps slow down to compensate, which can cause the upstream mill to fill faster than the downstream equipment can process. Solutions: (1) Increase fat content (cocoa butter) significantly - 19% may not be enough. (2) If max level alarms occur, manually transfer from Mill2 to conche first, then Mill1 to Mill2. (3) Reduce pump speeds on Mixer (45Hz) and Mill1 (45Hz), keep Mill2 at 60Hz. (4) Consider adding additional 20kg cocoa butter if viscosity is causing persistent issues.
