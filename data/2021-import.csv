"Ball Mill 130 roller disc alarm - heater protection","The 130kg ball mill is showing a roller disc alarm. How do we clear it?","Set the roller disc to 70 degrees and the alarm will disappear. This is a protection for the heater - when the roller disc setting is too low, the alarm activates as a safety measure. Once adjusted to 70 degrees, the heater protection alarm clears immediately.",Ball Mill,Electrical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2021-03-10,Troubleshooting,"roller disc, alarm, heater protection, 70 degrees, mill 130"
"Conche liquid sensor disconnect requires PLC modification","We no longer use the liquid sensor on the conche. How do we disconnect it without triggering alarms?","The liquid sensor cannot simply be disconnected - it requires a PLC program modification to avoid triggering an alarm. Juri will make the modification when he makes other scheduled PLC changes to the mill. The sensor disconnect and mill modifications will be done together to minimize downtime.",Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2021-03-11,Troubleshooting,"liquid sensor, disconnect, PLC modification, alarm bypass"
"Ball Mill 130 solenoid valve not working","The replacement solenoid valve was installed on the 130kg ball mill but it still doesn't work when the EV button is pressed. Water temperature is not dropping as expected.","Troubleshooting steps: 1) Set product temperature set point below the real temperature and check if water temperature drops. 2) Check voltage output to the valve at terminals 3 and 4 inside the power board (should read 24V). 3) If voltage is present, check the cable between the terminal block and the solenoid valve for continuity - disconnect both ends and test with a multimeter set to continuity mode. The issue was traced to the cable/relay, and a replacement relay KR5 was shipped from Italy (DHL tracking: 2447876572, delivered March 19).",Ball Mill,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin / Juri",2021-03-11,Troubleshooting,"solenoid valve, EV button, relay KR5, multimeter, continuity test, 24V, cable check"
"Conche pump oil level check - life greased pumps","How do I check the oil level in the conche pump to ensure it has enough? Does it have a dipstick?","The pumps are life-greased - there is no dipstick on the pump gearbox. Under normal operation, no maintenance is needed. You should only check the grease level if one of the gearbox seals has leaked a lot of oil. In that case, you would need to replace the seals and check the grease in the gearbox. If there is no visible leaking from the gearbox, the pumps do not need any grease maintenance.",Conche,Preventive Maintenance,low,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2021-03-13,Preventive Maintenance,"pump, oil level, grease, gearbox, life greased, dipstick, maintenance"
"Sifter flex pipe clamp falling off during operation","The flex pipe clamp connecting the sifter to the tank keeps falling off during sifting, even when tightened as much as possible.","There is an adjustable clamp that fixes the tube to the sifter. If the clamp is tightened fully and still falls off, it may be too loose for the connection. Send photos showing how it is currently fixed so the team can assess the fit. The vibration during sifting can work loose connections over time.",Sifter,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2021-03-17,Troubleshooting,"flex pipe, clamp, falling off, vibration, adjustable clamp"
"KR5 relay replacement - no special instructions","Are there any special instructions for installing the new KR5 relay that was shipped from Italy?","No special instructions needed - just place the cables in the same position as the original relay.

"Ball Mill 130 transfer valve PLC safety controls","Will the signal cable from the valve to the PLC allow the 130 to automatically open/close valves to the conche?","The modification will open and close the transfer valve between mill and conche, preventing the two mills from trying to send product to the conche at the same time. However, you cannot control any part of the conche from the mill 130 - conche valves can only be activated from the conche control panel. The mill 130 cannot start the conche process after the last download. You can use the same cable used for relay tests if long enough, otherwise get a standard 2-wire cable locally (no need to ship from Italy).

"Ball mill processing times for pre-refine in 130kg mill","How long does it typically take to pre-refine in the 130kg mill? We're getting shorter times than expected.","Typical times: 45 minutes for cacao liquor only, then 60 minutes after adding sugar/milk powder. This yields approximately 18-20 microns. You might extend 15-20 minutes for finer results. Processing time can be faster depending on the bean's fat content and fluidity. The amount of product matters too - less mass means faster particle size reduction. An hour give or take is normal for the pre-refine stage.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2021-04-15,Operation,"processing time, pre-refine, microns, 130kg, particle size, liquor, sugar"
"Cooling carousel not starting - microswitch and inverter check","The cooling carousel won't start. No visible issues with connections and nothing tripped inside the electrical cabinet.","Troubleshooting steps: 1) Check if the microswitch on the cooling carousel door is properly closed (check the red one specifically). 2) Open the electrical cabinet (must turn machine off first, then back on with door open). 3) Try starting the carousel and observe the inverter inside the cabinet - take a video. 4) Check machine parameters via the display. Issue was resolved via video call with Juri who diagnosed the problem through the inverter behavior.",Roaster,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2021-04-16,Troubleshooting,"cooling carousel, microswitch, inverter, electrical cabinet, won't start"
"Roaster recipe duplication when saving","Profiles/recipes are getting duplicated in the recipe window. Why is this happening?","When you open a recipe and press SAVE, the system creates a duplicate because it saves it as a new entry rather than overwriting. You cannot overwrite a recipe - if you edit one, you must change the name. Otherwise it creates a duplicate with the same name. To avoid duplicates, always change the recipe name when making modifications before saving.",Roaster,Software/PLC,low,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2021-04-19,Operation,"recipe, duplication, save, overwrite, profile management"
"Conche stopped overnight - voltage dip alarm circuit","The conche was left running overnight but was found stopped in the morning. The display showed the program was on but nothing was actually running. No alarms were visible.","If there is a voltage dip (even momentary), the alarm board reads it as an alarm and turns off the 24V circuits, stopping everything. You must press the blue physical button on the machine to rearm the 24V power. The display may still show the program status even though the circuits are off. If this happens again, leave the machine as-is and notify Packint immediately so they can connect remotely to diagnose.",Conche,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2021-04-19,Troubleshooting,"voltage dip, alarm circuit, 24V, blue button, rearm, overnight stop, power interruption"
"Conche minimum water temperature setting for automatic mode","What should the MIN T water be set to when operating the conche in automatic mode?","When operating in automatic mode, set the MIN T water (on the left side of the display) to 40. This setting is not operative - it is purely a safety protection. If you leave it at 53 and a phase decreases the temperature to say 50, the safety protection kicks in and stops the machine. In automatic mode this value should always be set to 40. In manual mode, it serves as the actual minimum temperature control.",Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2021-04-19,Operation,"minimum temperature, water temp, auto mode, safety protection, MIN T, 40 degrees"
"Sifter screen rubber gasket reassembly","How does the rubber gasket go back on the sifter screen after cleaning? It seems too big and doesn't fit properly.","The rubber gasket goes around the mesh (screen), not the ring. It may seem large because it's designed to be easy to remove and replace. If it appears loose, push it evenly on all the circumference - bring it slightly more toward the edge of the stainless steel. If pushed completely down it will seem too loose. Make it even all around. If it keeps slipping off on one side, a replacement with tighter fit can be sent with the next spare parts delivery. A new mesh with two rubber gaskets (one pre-mounted, one replacement) was shipped, both sized smaller than the original.",Sifter,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei / Martina",2021-04-21,Cleaning,"rubber gasket, mesh, screen, reassembly, fit, circumference, cleaning"
"Roaster gas flames coming from burner openings - low gas pressure","The roaster had flames coming out of the burner area openings and we could smell gas. We shut down the machine and called the gas company. Gas pressure measured at 7 inches water column.","Two possible causes: 1) Gas leak in the pipe (flame would come from the leak location), 2) Gas pressure too low - ideal pressure should be 8-10 inches water column (7 is too low). With low gas pressure, the pilot flame is too low and when the burner ignites, it takes a few seconds. During this delay, the burner chamber fills with gas, and when the flame reaches it, it creates a large flame shooting out the sides. The gas company confirmed no leaks. Solution: Check pilot flame height (take a photo/video for Packint), and address gas pressure - determine if the low pressure is temporary or permanent. If the pilot flame is too low, Juri can explain how to adjust its height.",Roaster,Mechanical,critical,"Packint Tech Support - Juri / Lorenzo Datei",2021-04-22,Troubleshooting,"gas flames, burner, gas pressure, water column, pilot flame, safety, ignition delay"
"Conche liquid sensor PLC modification","How can we disconnect the liquid sensor on the conche without getting alarms?","Juri needs to modify the PLC program to disable the liquid sensor alarm. This modification will be done at the same time as the mill PLC modifications. Without the program change, disconnecting the sensor will trigger a continuous alarm. The modification was scheduled to be done remotely.",Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2021-04-22,Troubleshooting,"liquid sensor, PLC modification, alarm, disconnect, remote programming"
"Mistral temperature knob accidentally moved - reading 160C","The Mistral on the conche is reading 20A at 160C even though it's set to the lowest temperature. Usually we run it at 80-90C.","The red temperature knob was accidentally moved, likely when the unit was off. The dial is extremely sensitive - even a slight nudge will cause the temperature to increase dramatically. Turn the knob counterclockwise to bring the temperature back to a maximum of 60C. Always verify the temperature when starting the Mistral because the unit can reach very high temperatures. The adjustment resolved the issue immediately.",Conche,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro / Lorenzo Datei",2021-06-04,Troubleshooting,"mistral, temperature knob, red dial, 160C, sensitive, counterclockwise, overheating"
"Conche product temperature calibration procedure","The conche display shows the product temperature about 8C lower than what we measure with external thermometers. How can we calibrate the temperature sensor?","To calibrate, you need to collect at least 10 paired measurements: one column with the temperature shown on the conche display and a second column with your thermometer reading. Take measurements at different times of day, across different days, and ideally with different products. If the relationship between the two temperatures is linear, the software can be corrected. Measure the surface temperature (and bottom temperature if possible) with a contact thermometer - not a laser, as the surface may be affected by hot air from the Mistral. The measurements need to be compiled into a spreadsheet and sent to Packint.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2021-06-04,Troubleshooting,"temperature calibration, product temp, thermometer, linear correction, software, measurement pairs"
"Ball mill max temperature settings for dark and milk chocolate","What are the correct maximum water and product temperature settings for the ball mill when processing dark vs milk chocolate?","Dark Chocolate: Water 45C max, Product 55C max.

These settings should be used for both the 50kg and 130kg ball mills.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2021-10-25,Operation,"temperature settings, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, water temp, product temp, max temperature"
"Ball mill 55% dark chocolate processing - high viscosity","Processing 55% dark chocolate (45% sugar) in the ball mill. The product is very thick and the water temperature was set to 52C. Running for 165 minutes to reach 15 microns.","Water temperature should never exceed 40-45C. Set to: Product T 50, Delta 10. The thickness is caused by the high sugar content and fine refining (15 microns is very low). With more sugar and less cacao, the product will be more viscous. For the stirrer speed, use 50-60 Hz - maximum speed (60 Hz) reduces refining time but requires more cold water for temperature control. Never go below 50 Hz for the stirrer. Also check the water refill frequency - it should be set to 999 minutes, not 100 minutes. Setting it to 100 means fresh cold water enters every 100 minutes, which can cause sudden temperature drops.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei / Franklin",2021-07-27,Operation,"55% dark, viscosity, sugar content, water temperature, stirrer speed, Hz, refill frequency, 999 minutes"
"Roaster probe explanation - drum vs product temperature","The product temperature display on the roaster never goes above 103C. Is the probe accurate? We told another chocolate maker the temperatures don't seem reliable.","There are two probes: 1) DRUM temperature (upper probe, blue line on graph, position 9) - this is your SOLE AND ONLY REFERENCE. It measures the air/environment temperature in the drum center and controls the burner. 2) Product temperature (lower probe, red line) - this is a MERE REFERENCE only. It cannot measure actual bean temperature because beans are constantly moving, and Pt100 probes measure fluid/air temperature, not moving solid surfaces. The drum temperature IS the accurate internal temperature. When you set 120C, the burner stays on until the DRUM reaches 120C. Product temperature will always read lower (around 100C) because the beans absorb heat in that zone. After 70-80+ minutes at steady temperature, all three values (drum, product probe, bean surface) will converge, but that is not the goal of roasting.",Roaster,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei",2021-08-17,Operation,"drum temperature, product temperature, probe, Pt100, blue line, red line, reference, upper probe, lower probe"
"Cooling carousel sensor connector broken","The cooling carousel won't run unless someone physically holds the sensor cable in place. The connector that registers the circular door position has broken apart.","The sensor cable connector broke and needs replacement. A new connector was quoted and sent to the customer. In the meantime, holding/pushing the cable in allows the carousel to function. The wires inside may be frayed where the connector meets the cable.

"Sifter brush bolts spinning - cannot remove for cleaning","The hex bolts holding the sifter brushes just spin because the back bolt inside the bristles has no resistance. This makes it impossible to remove the brushes for cleaning between allergens (milk to dark).","The issue with spinning bolts was escalated to the team for investigation. Note that for allergen cleaning between milk and dark chocolate, complete removal of residuals to meet legal thresholds is virtually impossible regardless of brush removal. However, cleaning as much as possible is still recommended. Lorenzo forwarded the issue to the mechanical team for a solution.

"Ball mill temperature dropping during processing - refill frequency","The ball mill temperature keeps dropping to 27C during processing. The blue heater button is on and the machine is in the second phase.","Check the water refill frequency setting - it was set to 100 minutes instead of 999 minutes. At 100 minutes, fresh cold water enters the mill every ~2 hours, causing the temperature to plummet. Change the refill frequency to 999 minutes. Additionally, for 55% dark chocolate with high sugar content, the stirrer speed should be between 50-60 Hz. The higher the stirrer speed, the faster the refining but the more cold water is needed. Seasonal temperature changes (colder incoming water in fall/winter) can also amplify the cooling effect. After correcting the refill setting, reheat the machine and restart processing.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Lorenzo Datei / Franklin",2021-09-20,Troubleshooting,"temperature drop, refill frequency, 999 minutes, cold water, stirrer speed, heating"
"Facility move - disassembly and transport guidance","We are moving our facility in a few weeks (less than 8 km). What are the best practices for disassembling, palletizing, and transporting the equipment?","A 5-page disassembly manual PDF was provided. Key guidance: 1) Pallet dimensions from original 2019 and 2020 packing lists were shared. 2) Side walls on wooden crates are not necessary for short-distance moves - just ensure machines are securely tied to pallets and well-protected with film and packing material. 3) Remove wheels from the WINNOWER only (use the bolt holes where wheels were to secure it to the pallet). Leave wheels on all other machines. 4) For the 130kg ball mill: remove the adjustable feet before placing on the pallet. 5) Photos of properly palletized 130kg mills were shared for reference.",General - All Equipment,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin / Alvaro / Juri / Martina",2021-12-08,Installation,"facility move, disassembly, palletizing, transport, packing, wheels, crating"
"Ball Mill 130 ball removal port - gasket and procedure","How do we remove the balls from the 130kg mill? How does the ball removal port cover work? How fast do the balls come out?","Remove the 2 sunken bolts - the 3rd bolt acts as a hinge (loosen it but don't remove). Pry above the seal with a flat tool (crowbar) carefully. WARNING: Do not open completely as balls will come out very fast. Once you crack it open, you can reverse the cap to stop the flow, then put back one screw and slide the cap to start/stop the flow as needed. The blue seal/gasket is a rubber seal. Replacement gaskets were available from the NY office.

"Anti-static bar for pre-refiner - product inquiry","We noticed Packint has an anti-static bar for the pre-refiner. Who inspired that? How much does it cost?","The anti-static bar was inspired by Hubert Masse, a chocolate maker in France. It was tested and works well. Price is approximately $1000 (quotation sent by email). However, static is not always present - it depends on the environment and occurs particularly at low humidity. Proper grounding of machines also plays an important role in reducing static.
