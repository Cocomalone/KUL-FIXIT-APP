"Water refill procedure for conche and ball mills after facility move","What is the correct process to refill the conche and ball mills with water after relocating? A colleague who worked at Dandelion mentioned their conche got dented during refill.","Ball Mill: Open the internal valve (after the external valve) to allow water entry. Then open the external valve and monitor the water level through the sight glass. Once at maximum, turn on the water pump and wait until you hear water returning to the internal tank. Check that level is at maximum, then close the internal valve. Conche: Connect the hose to the drain valve and use it to allow water in. Wait until the level reaches maximum, then turn on the water pump and check the level again. Important: All pipe connections must be ready before turning on the water pump.",General - All Equipment,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin",2022-01-03,Operation,"water refill, conche, ball mill, water level, sight glass, pump, facility move"
"Ball Mill 130 valve disconnection order for transport","Which valve should we disconnect first when preparing the 130kg ball mill for transport?","No specific order for electrical disconnection, but for mechanical disconnection, remove the upper valve first, then the lower one. The valves are always connected to power on the 130kg mill.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin",2022-01-03,Installation,"valve, disconnection, transport, upper valve, lower valve, 130kg"
"Conche strapping for transport - remove cover first","Can transport straps go over the top of the conche for moving?","Remove the cover first, then use the straps on top. Do not put straps on the ingredient loading hopper - it is not a good place for securing. Use two straps on the top without the cover for safe transport.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin",2022-01-03,Installation,"strapping, transport, cover removal, hopper, moving"
"Conche forklift lifting points","Where are the best places to lift the conche with a forklift?","Using the forklift, position it between the brackets - one for the tank and one for the recirculation pump. The forklift must be centered between these areas. Alternative: disassemble the pump and associated pipes including the filter, then use the forklift only for the conche tank. Pipes can remain attached during the move.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin",2022-01-07,Installation,"forklift, lifting points, brackets, pump, transport, moving"
"Roaster heat vent exhaust routing - side wall vs roof","Can the roaster heat vent exhaust be routed out the side of the building instead of through the roof?","Yes, it can be vented out the side, but depending on height and angle it may need an external fan to help draw the smoke out. Ideal setup is through the roof where everything rises naturally. A 45-degree angle to the side wall should work fine. A 90-degree angle (horizontal) would be problematic. Vertically 20 feet is also fine because smoke and heat naturally rise. Also check local building codes - some jurisdictions have rules about exhaust placement, especially if the exterior wall faces a high-traffic area like a street or parking lot.",Roaster,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2022-01-10,Installation,"heat vent, exhaust, side wall, roof, chimney, building codes, fan"
"Ball mill oil level check - 130kg vs 50kg","How do we determine proper oil levels for both the 130kg and 50kg ball mills?","130kg Mill: The oil level should be between the two lines on the sight bolt, closer to the lower line. 50kg Mill: There is a level window on the front of the gearbox - the oil level should be at half of the window.",Ball Mill,Preventive Maintenance,low,"Packint Tech Support - Juri",2022-01-22,Preventive Maintenance,"oil level, gearbox, sight glass, 130kg, 50kg, maintenance"
"Conche water level drops after filling with EV button","After topping off the conche water level using the EV button, the level immediately drops again. Is that normal?","Yes, that is how it has always worked. When you fill with the EV button, wait until water comes from the drainage to know it is full. Then the level will settle to approximately 3/4 of the sight glass - that is the normal maximum fill level.",Conche,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2022-02-23,Operation,"water level, EV button, sight glass, drainage, conche fill"
"Sifter heating band not working","One of the heating bands on the sifter (front one) is not warming up even with the potentiometer dial set to maximum.","If the potentiometer (dial) is set to max and the heating band is not warming, that section needs to be replaced.

"Conche water temperature and product temperature relationship","The conche water temperature and product temperature show a big difference. How do they relate?","The water temperature is the heating driver - if you want to raise the product temperature, increase the water temperature. The maximum product temperature setting is used for cooling. It must remain at a maximum value so the machine can call cold water, which also keeps the internal water level constant. The machine must be connected online for remote verification of proper operation.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Riccardo Rebolini",2022-02-28,Operation,"water temperature, product temperature, heating driver, cooling, set point"
"Reconnecting machines to WiFi after facility move - Sevio router","How do we reconnect the machines to WiFi at the new facility using the Sevio routers?","Each machine has a Sevio router with an antenna. For each machine: 1) Get the correct .txt configuration file (contains WiFi credentials). 2) Put only that file on a FAT32-formatted USB drive. 3) Insert the USB into the port underneath the Sevio router (not the touchscreen USB). 4) Leave the USB in for at least 2 minutes before removing. 5) Check the three LEDs on the router to confirm connection. The WiFi network name in the config file must match exactly (case-sensitive). If the name is wrong, new config files must be generated server-side.",General - All Equipment,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin / Alvaro / Juri",2022-03-07,Installation,"Sevio, router, WiFi, USB, FAT32, network, configuration, reconnect"
"Ball mill FM button - temperature safety bypass","What does the FM button on the ball mill do? The machine won't start with low temperature settings.","FM stands for temperature bypass. The FM button bypasses the temperature protection safety, allowing you to start the motors even if the temperatures are below the configured set point. Use it when you know the machine is at a safe temperature to operate but the set points are configured lower than the current reading.",Ball Mill,Software/PLC,low,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin",2022-04-12,Operation,"FM button, bypass, temperature safety, set point, motors"
"Ball mill leaning pipe fix","The ball mill discharge pipe is leaning. How can it be fixed?","The quickest fix is to tighten the bolts that fix the pipe to the flange very well. If that doesn't work, create a bracket on the ceiling to prevent the pipe from rotating. Try the tightening solution first - it is usually sufficient.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Riccardo Rebolini",2022-04-12,Repair,"leaning pipe, flange, bolts, bracket, pipe rotation"
"Pre-refiner R4 oil leak from tipping during transit","Our R4 pre-refiner tipped over during transit and oil leaked out. Is the machine damaged? What kind of oil does it need?","The oil leaked from the open gear pan on the right side - it holds oil for the gears and has no cover. The machine is not permanently damaged - just refill with oil. Use synthetic gear oil with EP 1000 viscosity (such as TOTAL Carter EP 1000 or Miles Lubricants Synthetic Gear Oil from Grainger). The R4 has two oil trays, each needs about 2.5kg, for a total of 5kg. Fill each well close to the front edge, adding gradually until the oil settles a few centimeters below the edge.",Pre-refiner,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro / Riccardo Rebolini",2022-04-20,Repair,"R4, oil leak, gear pan, transit damage, EP 1000, synthetic gear oil, 5kg"
"Conche pump seal leak - tightening procedure","The conche is leaking chocolate from the pump seal area. How do we fix it?","Tighten the pump seal bolts 90 degrees uniformly on each bolt while the pump is running. Only do one tightening pass per bolt. If bolts are uneven, measure the distance from the pump head to the bronze piece to determine which is furthest, then tighten to match the closer one. Use a caliper for accuracy. Clean up chocolate and continue running to verify the leak stopped. A PDF procedure document was provided for reference.",Conche,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2022-05-27,Repair,"pump seal, leak, tightening, bolts, bronze piece, caliper, uniform"
"Roaster display swap between T35 and T100","Is it possible to swap the display screen from the 35kg roaster to the 100kg roaster that has a smaller screen?","The feasibility was investigated by Packint. The complete electrical panel can be replaced, cables swapped, and a second temperature probe added for product temperature (the T100 purchased didn't include this). A quotation was sent for the full panel replacement, new cables, and probe addition. This would give the T100 the same modern interface as the T35.",Roaster,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro / Martina / Giacomo",2022-06-09,Specification,"display swap, T35, T100, electrical panel, screen, probe, upgrade"
"Conche emulsifier repeatedly tripping - under-refined cacao","The conche emulsifier keeps tripping with an error, even on less viscous recipes. What could be causing this?","Multiple causes investigated: 1) Check voltage stability. 2) Set emulsifier speed to 50Hz instead of max. 3) Increase pre-refine time for cacao by 10-15 minutes before adding sugar. Under-refining the cacao at the beginning can cause over-refining of sugar, leading to higher viscosity. Also check recipe: ~38% fat with lecithin should be fairly fluid - if thick, there may be moisture or water somewhere. 4) The emulsifier breaker amperage was adjusted from 14A to 14.5A. After extending cacao refining time and adjusting the breaker, the issue was resolved.",Conche,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro / Franklin / Riccardo",2022-06-15,Troubleshooting,"emulsifier, tripping, under-refined, cacao, viscosity, breaker, amperage, pre-refine time"
"100kg roaster recipe transfer from 35kg roaster","We purchased a second-hand T100 roaster. How do we transfer recipes from our T35? What adjustments are needed?","Password for the T100 from Tweed: 1910 (or 1510). Times and temperatures from the T35 transfer directly to the T100. If loading 100kg, times are similar to the T35. If loading only 50kg, times may be shorter (5-10% reduction). The bean tester only works with full loads (50kg is not enough for beans to fall into the tester). Note: The T100 from Tweed has older software that requires separate training.",Roaster,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2022-10-06,Operation,"T100, T35, recipe transfer, password, 1910, batch size, times, temperatures"
"100kg roaster pneumatic tilt piston - missing parts","The T100 roaster purchased from Tweed is missing parts for the pneumatic tilt piston. The previous owner had a rigid chimney and eliminated the tilt function. What parts are needed?","The pneumatic leg foot is pressurized and pushes down to remove. The foot from the T35 was too small for the T100. Components needed to connect the lift piston: 1) Two 1/4-inch hoses, 2) One 1/4-inch T-connector, 3) Two flow regulators for piston ascent and descent. Both air connections (in and out) on the piston are necessary. These are standard pneumatic parts available from Grainger, Festo, or Camozzi in the US. The roaster can be used without the tilt function enabled temporarily.",Roaster,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Franklin / Giacomo",2022-10-07,Repair,"T100, pneumatic, tilt piston, missing parts, 1/4 inch, hoses, T-connector, flow regulators"

"Pre-refiner R4 blade orientation and dial reset","Which direction do the blades go against the rollers on the R4? How do we reset the pressure dials to zero?","For the blades: the flat edge touches the roller and the curved edge faces outward/away from the roll. For the dials: remove the dial by unscrewing the tiny screws on the sides (3 screws), then spin the whole dial counterclockwise while holding it upright until it reaches zero. Make sure the handle is completely closed when you put it back in place. There is a bolt behind the center gauge that secures the handle to the mechanism.",Pre-refiner,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2022-10-19,Operation,"R4, blade orientation, flat edge, dial reset, counterclockwise, screws"
"Pre-refiner R4 cacao buildup in top chamber","Cacao is building up in the top chamber of the R4 pre-refiner instead of passing through properly.","The bottom roll is too tight.

"Conche temperature drop between phases - thermal inertia","The conche water temperature drops well below the set point when transitioning between phases (e.g., Phase 2 at 62C to Phase 3 at 58C). Why does this happen?","When transitioning from a higher to lower temperature phase, cold water enters the circuit to lower the product temperature. Due to thermal inertia, the water temperature drops beyond the set point by many degrees. The large volume of cold water entering causes the significant temperature drop. Solution: Keep only 2 degrees of difference between phases instead of 4. Also, the manual mode water temperature setting acts as the safety block - if the auto mode temperature drops below the manual mode setting, the stirrer and pump stop. Packint made a software modification so the water temperature in automatic mode (not manual) controls the stirrer and pump block.",Conche,Software/PLC,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo / Alvaro",2022-10-21,Troubleshooting,"temperature drop, thermal inertia, cold water, phase transition, software modification, block temperature"
"Conche FM bypass button for starting auto mode","When switching to auto mode on the conche, the stirrer and pump won't start even though the program is set. We had to trick it by going to manual first.","The issue is that the auto temperature is higher than the current water temperature (which is governed by the manual mode setting). To start the auto cycle when the temperature is slightly below the manual minimum, press the grey FM button to the left of the auto/manual toggle switch. The FM button is a bypass that allows the cycle to start when water temp is just below the minimum threshold.",Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2022-11-14,Operation,"FM button, bypass, auto mode, manual mode, temperature block, stirrer, pump"
"Ball mill 50kg unable to pump chocolate-oil mix to conche","The 50kg ball mill won't pump a chocolate and sunflower oil mixture to the conche, even though the 3-way valve works and product recirculates internally.","The mixture was too liquid for the pump to push through the pipe all the way to the conche. Troubleshooting: 1) Drain the mill into buckets, 2) Remove and clean the magnetic filter cover cavity, 3) Use compressed air to push back from the conche side to verify pipes are clear, 4) Add more chocolate to increase viscosity. In this case, the 130kg mill was used to push enough product through first, which allowed the oil mixture to follow through the now-primed pipes.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2022-11-10,Troubleshooting,"50kg, pump, chocolate-oil mix, too liquid, pipes, compressed air, magnetic filter"
"Winnower not starting - emergency button pressed","The winnower won't start. The machine powers on but nothing runs when the start button is pressed.","Check the emergency stop button on the opposite side of the machine. If it is pressed (engaged), the winnower will not run. Release the emergency button and the machine will start normally. Always verify the e-stop on both sides of the machine before troubleshooting further.",Winnower,Electrical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2022-11-17,Troubleshooting,"winnower, emergency button, e-stop, won't start"
"T100 roaster old software training and PLC upgrade","The T100 roaster has old software that is very different from our T35. Can we get training and possibly upgrade the PLC?","The T100 from Tweed has older technology that Packint no longer uses. Remote training was provided by Franklin at a rate of 100 euro/hour (since it was a second-hand machine not purchased directly from Packint). The software can be upgraded to match the T35 by replacing the complete electrical panel, cables, and adding a second temperature probe. A quotation was sent for this upgrade. A technical report was also provided documenting the training session.",Roaster,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo / Franklin",2022-11-17,Operation,"T100, old software, training, PLC upgrade, electrical panel, second-hand"
"Chocolate storage tank - stirrer won't work without water","The chocolate storage tank's stirrer won't turn when we press the mixer start button. The motor fan sounds like it's hitting the cover.","The tank requires water in the jacket circuit and must be heated to the set temperature before the stirrer will work (same principle as the conche). If the tank is not hot, the stirrer will not turn - this is a thermal protection. CRITICAL: Never heat the tank without water in the jacket - the heating resistances will burn out. Fill the water circuit first, then set the water temperature on the thermoregulator. Once the water reaches the set temperature, the stirrer will operate.",General - All Equipment,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo / Alvaro / Franklin",2022-06-10,Operation,"storage tank, stirrer, water jacket, thermal protection, heating, resistances"
"Conche pump noise - worn lobes inspection","The conche pump is making unusual noise at 50Hz with nearly full load (240kg). What could be causing it?","The noise could be from worn lobes inside the pump head. Remove the front cover of the pump and inspect the lobes for wear.

"Conche software upgrade - minimum temperature key addition","Packint proposed a software modification for the conche. What does the upgrade include?","The modification adds an additional key to set the minimum temperature directly, without changes to the existing panel layout. This eliminates the previous issue where the manual mode temperature acted as the block temperature for automatic mode. The upgrade was offered via email with detailed explanation of the changes.",Conche,Software/PLC,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo / Martina",2022-11-24,Specification,"software upgrade, minimum temperature, key, conche, modification"
"100kg roaster exhaust pipe size requirements","Can we use the existing 6-inch (150mm) ceiling vent for the 100kg roaster, or does the entire exhaust need to be 10 inches (250mm)?","The hot air blower chimney is 80mm (3 inches). The heat vent requires a 250mm (10 inch) chimney for the first section coming out of the roaster (must be flexible). However, the last section going through the ceiling can remain at 150mm (6 inches). The smaller final section will only increase the speed of the fumes. So the pipe from the roaster must start at 250mm but can reduce to 150mm for the ceiling penetration.",Roaster,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Riccardo Rebolini",2022-05-05,Installation,"exhaust pipe, 250mm, 150mm, chimney, heat vent, T100, ceiling vent"
