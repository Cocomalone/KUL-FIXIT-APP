"SOTU 600 mills high temp alarms after 100 minutes of milling","After about 100 minutes of milling on the SOTU 600 line, we get high temperature alarms. Our cooling company says the chiller is fine. The coolant supply lines read 16.3°C and 20.3°C. What's causing this?","The chiller water temperature is too high. The incoming water at 16°C cannot properly cool the mills - it should be 5-7°C at the chiller outlet. At 16°C, the water cannot absorb enough heat from the product. The water temperature in the mills should be set to 40°C with product at 50°C (5-10°C difference). The temperature probes have a normal variation of about 1°C compared to an immersion thermometer reading. The issue is with the chiller performance, not the mills - have your refrigeration technician verify the chiller output temperature and water flow rate.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-01-14,Troubleshooting,"SOTU 600, high temp alarm, chiller water, 16°C, should be 5-7°C, 100 minutes, cooling, water temperature"
"Melter water temperature probe out of calibration","The melter touch screen shows 54.4°C but a physical thermometer reads 47.7°C when set to 56°C. Later when set to 60°C, the screen shows 57.6°C but thermometer reads 53.8°C.","The temperature probe is likely out of calibration. The heaters are working (temperature is rising), but there's a consistent offset between the probe reading and actual temperature. Try leaving the set point at 60°C and check again after 2 hours to see if the actual temperature continues to rise. If the offset remains consistent (3-4°C difference), the probe may need to be replaced. Packint can monitor remotely to observe the reading behavior.",General - All Equipment,Electrical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-01-15,Troubleshooting,"melter, temperature probe, calibration, offset, 3-4°C difference, replace probe"
"SOTU 600 must be used in full automatic mode","We've been loading ingredients manually and refining manually, then using auto only to unload to the conche. Packint says we should use full auto. Why?","The SOTU 600 line is designed for fully automatic operation from start to finish. Using it partially manual reduces performance and can cause issues. The mixer pump turns on/off based on the mill level sensor in both Auto and Manual modes. Recipes do not affect pump operation - the level sensors control that. Check the mixer tare and do all ingredient loads in automatic mode. The pumps and level sensors manage the flow automatically, adjusting speeds to maintain proper levels.",Ball Mill/Conche,Operation,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-01-22,Operation,"SOTU 600, automatic mode, full auto, manual mode, level sensors, pump control, tare, performance"
"Mill-50 water pump replacement - VFD pole jumper fix","Installed the new water pump on the Mill-50 but the VFD keeps tripping. After fixing that, the pump won't start even though the 'pump on' switch lights up.","Two issues: (1) The VFD was tripping because the jumper for the motor poles was reversed. Once the jumper polarity was corrected, the VFD stopped tripping. (2) After that fix, the drive was faulted without displaying an error code. Power cycling (resetting) the drive resolved the issue and the pump started running normally. The motor does free-spool when unpowered, confirming no mechanical lock-up.",Ball Mill,Electrical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo, Hunter Peterson",2025-02-05,Repair,"Mill-50, water pump, VFD, tripping, jumper poles reversed, drive fault, no error code, power cycle"
"Conche 2 valve still not opening - minimum 7 bar air pressure required","We upgraded air lines and added an 80-gallon air tank but the conche 2 valve still won't open. The pressure gauge shows 6.5 bar.","The minimum air pressure for the valve to operate is 7 bar - your 6.5 bar is insufficient. Even with the air line upgrades and added tank, you need to verify 7+ bar at the valve. Additionally: (1) Check that the valve physically rotates correctly and isn't still stuck mechanically. (2) Clean the level sensor in the tank thoroughly. (3) The TK1000 has a selector on the panel door to choose which conche sends product - verify it's set correctly. (4) If the sensor is dirty or the valve doesn't rotate perfectly, the conche pump won't operate.",Conche,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-02-12,Troubleshooting,"Conche 2, valve, 7 bar minimum, air pressure, 6.5 bar insufficient, level sensor, TK1000 selector"
"Conche 2 valve not actuating - loose wire diagnosis","The valve still won't open even with 7 bar pressure. Video shows no air sound when the download button is pressed. What else can we check?","Check for a loose wire: (1) Check if the valve coil has voltage when the button is pressed. (2) Try pressing the blue button directly on the valve to see if it rotates manually. (3) Pull apart the valve assembly and inspect the electrical connector for loose wires. In this case, after shutting down the entire machine and removing voltage, the valve button started working. After turning the machine back on, it worked a few times then stopped again. A new valve was installed and eventually the loose wire was found in the connector or terminal block. The valve connector wiring was the root cause.",Conche,Electrical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo, Hunter Peterson",2025-02-18,Repair,"Conche 2, valve, loose wire, coil voltage, blue button, connector, terminal block"
"Conche valve opening delay timer is 3 minutes","The conche valve works now but after opening and closing once, it won't open again for a while. Is this normal?","Yes, this is by design. A timer prevents the valve from rapidly opening and closing, which protects against the level sensor continuously triggering open/close cycles when product touches the sensor. The delay is set to 3 minutes. This applies in both manual and automatic modes. After closing the valve, you must wait 3 minutes before it can be opened again.",Conche,Software/PLC,low,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-02-21,Specification,"valve delay, 3 minute timer, level sensor protection, open close cycle, anti-cycling"
"SOTU 600 Mill 2 high temp alarms - product 60°C water 50°C","Mill 2 is reading product temp 60°C and water 50°C even though both mills have the same settings of 50°C product and 40°C water. Mill 1 seems fine.","The cooling water entering Mill 2 is not cold enough. Check: (1) Both mills share the same chiller water circuit - verify the water flow is reaching Mill 2 adequately. (2) Press the EXC button on both mills to confirm the exchanger valves rotate correctly. (3) The thermostat behind the mills MUST be set to 60°C - this is a mechanical thermostat that generates an alarm when water reaches 60°C and prevents heater burnout. (4) If one mill had the thermostat set to 50 instead of 60, it would limit heating but also affect the cooling cycle behavior. (5) You can decrease the product temperature set point to 42°C to make the cooling inlet start earlier.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-02-24,Troubleshooting,"Mill 2, high temp, 60°C product, 50°C water, thermostat 60°C, EXC button, exchanger valve"
"SOTU 600 pump speeds dropping to 5-6Hz in auto mode","During auto operation, the pump speeds dropped to 5-6Hz. Packint says this shouldn't happen automatically - minimum in auto is 30Hz. We didn't change them manually.","The minimum pump speed in automatic mode is 30Hz - the software cannot set them lower than this. Speeds of 5-6Hz can only be set manually from the touch screen. Even in auto mode, manual speed changes can be made via the touch screen. Running pumps at such low speed will: (1) damage the pump and motor, (2) leave product in the mills too long causing overheating, and (3) cause over-refining and very high viscosity. If you find speeds below 30Hz, someone changed them manually. Always verify pump speeds are at the correct starting values before each cycle.",Ball Mill/Conche,Software/PLC,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-02-25,Troubleshooting,"pump speeds, 5-6Hz, minimum 30Hz, auto mode, manual change, over-refining, overheating"
"SOTU 600 level sensor alarm during auto - manual recovery procedure","The SOTU 600 triggered level sensor alarms in both mills during auto cycle. How do we manually get the chocolate out?","Switch to manual mode. Transfer in this order: (1) First empty Mill 2 - turn on Mill 2 pump and stirrer to send product to the conche (or mixer if needed). (2) Once Mill 2 level drops, turn on Mill 1 pump and stirrer to send product from Mill 1 to Mill 2. (3) Once Mill 1 level drops, turn on Mixer pump and stirrer. (4) Remember to open the correct valves from mixer to Mill 1 to Mill 2 to conche. To re-refine: set all recipe ingredients to zero and set a new refining time. Set mixer time to 1 minute. Start auto cycle - it will skip ingredient loading and begin refining the existing product.",Ball Mill/Conche,Operation,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo, Alvaro",2025-02-25,Operation,"SOTU 600, level sensor alarm, manual recovery, transfer order, Mill2 first, zero ingredients, re-refine"
"Mill 1 stirrer high amps at 40Hz causing alarms","Mill 1 stirrer is hitting 96 amps at 30Hz and getting max amp alarms. We can't seem to run the stirrer without alarms.","Lower the stirrer speed to a level where it won't alarm - try 35Hz, if still alarming try 30Hz or lower. Let it stir at the lower speed for a while to remix the chocolate, then gradually increase. If the product has been sitting, it may have separated (butter rises, solids settle) creating a thick mass at the bottom. Once flowing again, pump to Mill 2 to transfer out. If amp alarms persist even at low speeds, the chocolate is too viscous and may need additional cocoa butter added to reduce viscosity.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2025-02-25,Troubleshooting,"stirrer, high amps, 96 amps, 30Hz, lower speed, 35Hz, viscosity, separation, cocoa butter"
"Re-refining chocolate already in mixer - zero ingredient trick","The chocolate is back in the mixer and needs 20 more minutes of refining. How do we restart the auto cycle without loading new ingredients?","Set all ingredient weights to zero in the recipe, set the mixer time to 1 minute, and set the refining time to the amount needed (e.g., 20 minutes). Set download time as needed (or 0 if you'll transfer manually). Start the auto cycle - since all ingredient weights are zero and the mixer already has product exceeding those weights, the system skips the loading phase and proceeds to refining. Set pump speeds to 50Hz for mixer pump and stirrers to 50Hz. Ingredients must show zero on the recipe screen.",Ball Mill/Conche,Operation,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Alvaro",2025-02-25,Operation,"re-refine, zero ingredients, mixer time 1 minute, refining time, auto cycle, skip loading, pump speed 50Hz"
"Mill 1 exchanger actuator not working - causing overheating","Mill 1 keeps overheating during production. We discovered the exchanger actuator (cooling valve) on Mill 1 is not bringing in cold water from the chiller. Mill 2 with the same settings works fine.","The root cause is a non-functioning exchanger actuator on Mill 1. When the actuator fails to open the cooling valve, cold chiller water cannot flow through the heat exchanger, so Mill 1 overheats while Mill 2 (with a working actuator) cools normally. To verify: (1) Compare water temps - Mill 1 water at 42°C vs Mill 2 at 21°C confirms Mill 2 is cooling and Mill 1 is not. (2) The physical surface of Mill 1 will feel hot while Mill 2 feels cold. Contact Packint for replacement actuators. Note: Giacomo initially stated the valves were working because pressing the button when already open doesn't cause visible movement - verify by observing the valve while toggling.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,critical,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo, Hunter Peterson",2025-02-27,Repair,"Mill 1, exchanger actuator, overheating, cooling valve, cold water, replacement actuator, heat exchanger"
"Thermostat behind mills must be set to 60°C","What should the thermostat behind the ball mills be set to? Ours were set differently (one at 50, one at 60).","Both thermostats behind the mills MUST be set to 60°C. This is a mechanical thermostat that serves as a safety device - it generates an alarm when the water temperature reaches 60°C to prevent burning out the heaters. It does NOT control the operating temperature. The operating temperature is controlled by the touch screen settings. Setting this thermostat lower than 60 will cause premature alarms during normal operation.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,medium,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-02-28,Operation,"thermostat, behind mills, 60°C, mechanical, safety, heater protection, alarm"
"Chiller water flow rate and pressure diagnostics","We're having persistent cooling issues. Giacomo says the chiller circuit is the most common cause. What should we check?","In 99% of cooling failure cases, the chiller circuit is the problem. Check these critical parameters: (1) Water temperature AT THE INLET of the heat exchangers (not just at the chiller outlet). (2) Water temperature at the EXIT of the exchangers. (3) Flow rate of water from the chiller - insufficient flow means water passes too slowly through the exchanger and can't cool even if it's cold. (4) Pressure at the chiller outlet. (5) Return pressure to the chiller. (6) Water purity - limescale buildup in the chiller circuit or exchanger plates can block water flow. Low flow + cold water = poor cooling because the water doesn't move fast enough through the exchanger plates to transfer heat effectively.",Ball Mill,Mechanical,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-02-28,Troubleshooting,"chiller, water flow rate, pressure, exchanger inlet, outlet, limescale, flow rate, cooling failure"
"Mill heater buttons accidentally turned off - confusing UI","The mills are getting cold and the chocolate is cooling down. The PLC shows the heaters should be on but the temperatures keep dropping.","Someone accidentally pressed the heater buttons on the touch screen, turning them off. The heater button UI is confusing - it's not immediately obvious whether the button is on or off (red/green flashing). These buttons should only be pressed ONCE when first turning on the machine and then never touched again. If temperatures are dropping: (1) Check if the heater button shows consistent color (not intermittent). (2) If unsure, press the button ONCE and monitor - if temperature starts rising in 20 minutes, it was off. (3) Do NOT leave mills with heaters off overnight or the chocolate will solidify. Packint will update the program to make the on/off state more visible.",Ball Mill,Software/PLC,high,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-03-01,Troubleshooting,"heater buttons, turned off, confusing UI, red green, temperature dropping, program update coming"
"Mesh screen filter size is 250 micron not 25","The mesh screen filter label shows '25' - does this mean 25 micron?","No, the mesh screen size is 250 micron, not 25 micron. At higher operating speeds (50-60Hz), the effective filtering gets finer. Packint offers two mesh sizes: 150 micron for very fluid products and 250 micron for viscous products.

"Conche filter basket vs entire filter pricing","The quote for the conche filter was €5600. Is that just for the basket?","No, €5600 is the price for the entire filter assembly, not just the basket. If you only need the replacement basket (the internal screen/mesh component), the price will be significantly less. Clarify with Packint (aftersales@packint.com) that you need just the basket, not the complete filter unit.",Conche,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-01-28,Specification,"conche filter, basket, €5600, entire filter, replacement basket, pricing"
"Mill-50 water pump replacement received with damaged packaging","We received the new water pump for the Mill-50 but the shipping box was damaged. Should we be concerned?","Inspect the pump thoroughly before installation. Even with box damage, the pump may be fine. Test it by: (1) checking the motor free-spools, (2) inspecting for visible damage to connections and housing, (3) installing and testing operation. When installing: ensure the VFD jumper for motor poles is set correctly (this was the issue on a previous installation where the jumper was reversed, causing VFD tripping).",Ball Mill,Mechanical,low,"Packint Tech Support - Giacomo",2025-02-05,Installation,"Mill-50, water pump, shipping damage, inspect, VFD jumper, motor poles"
"SOTU 600 auto mode - minimum lecithin percentage","What is the minimum lecithin percentage for SOTU 600 recipes?","Packint recommends a minimum of 0.5% lecithin for SOTU 600 recipes. While 0.4% may work for some recipes, using less than the recommended amount increases the risk of viscosity-related issues including pump overcurrent faults, overheating in the mills, and max level sensor alarms.
